Are You covered Are You under this stone Can I call You Can I see You alone Will You show up Is it Your place or mine Are we friendly What You seek You shall find Seven road blocks From tonight Polka mini Obscurity defenestration Old fame reclaimed For straighter roads and rule by force New age of rage Of bias and uncivil wars Now it always start from the bottom When it comes to boil And our history always runs upon the foil And we always wish that the future Shall be born without pain But everybody wants to drive our train In the gutter we can settle the score But You don't know who You settle it for All around You is the enemy You dread And Your vision is a map of Your head A million toad halls The table's set Marble cake The princess on the pea is raging Old fame reclaimed For straighter roads and rule by force New age of rage Of bias and uncivil wars Are You covered Are You under this stone Can I call You Can I see You alone Will You show up Is it Your place or mine Undercurrent of the nation's decline
