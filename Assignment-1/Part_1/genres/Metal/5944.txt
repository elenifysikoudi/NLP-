On the day that you woke me up from our dream to your nightmare I didnt know it was possible to feel so alone being with you I tried to move but you glued me to your side with all that you gave me Did you catch the moon together When I saw the look upon your face I knew we had lost precious hours through our days Did her skin feel as soft as you always said mine are to your fingers Did her eyes look as deep into your soul as you always said mine did Hunting down all my strength to reveal that clouds have appeared for regression I tried to move but youve glued me to your side with all that you gave me Will I find my way home
