"Dark shadows from above Ravens fly obliterate the sun ""It's a sign of the devil He will come for his servant tonight"" These are dark times Suspicious minds breed like rats Guardians of corrupt morality Spread their filthy lies Am I to burn I have not sinned Burnt at the stake Innocent blood that can never be washed clean The flames of ignorance Grow higher and higher Licking my flesh burning my soul The raven laughing in the moon These are dark times Suspicious minds breed like rats Guardians of corrupt morality Spread their filthy lies again "
