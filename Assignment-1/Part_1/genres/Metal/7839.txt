Far beyond the walls of all safety in a land Disgusting as the highest of God's heavens Starved hands keep appearing clawing Tearing shreds out of the flesh and mind And as the sands crawl their unchanging path All means seemingly focus towards the end There is no reason to live anymore when the reason cannot be attained But the solace lay beyond the darkness In a land where light and life dwell Yet soon will come death and the numbing fires Only then will my mind lie to rest For I am alone on this world Enslaved and surrounded by the living dead Yet still I stand tall as I bleed Deep from within the cuts upon my skin
