You can't kill me I am living inside you I am a part of your existence Twisted thoughts in a twisted mind Provoking you Black is my heart dark is my soul My hatred I can not control Evil seed growing stronger Your freewill Dying Inside you heart of darkness A part of you heart of darkness To deny me is to deny yourself The illusion is dissolved You are no longer in control The facade crumbles the transition is complete The transition is complete I come to you in the night I am your dark subconscience I keep you awake knowing I am the heart of darkness
