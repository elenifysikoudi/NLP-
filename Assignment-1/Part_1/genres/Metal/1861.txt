If I can't be your friend I will be your enemy Try to destroy me before I destroy you Try to burn me yeah burn me yeah burn me yo But be aware my flame can burn you down It's too late now to hide Your soul is mine You know all sins bring forth a brand new sin Tear my flesh feed my pain drink my blood I don't care My evil thoughts will haunt you till your last breath Your scream won't be heard by no one but the inner man Who slowly addles you and paints your mind red It's too late now to hide Your soul is mine and my revenge needs blood and pain I release my demons giving you back All the pain that you caused It tears me apart but I don't mind I can't hold them back anymore I release my demons and separate right from wrong it's my escape song I release my demons and eliminate everything yeah everything That holds me back You can't hold me back This is my final attack This is my point of no return I got no way back My poisoned mind's ready to spread disease I'm down to zero Disillusioned This is how I feel But my collapse will destroy my enemies
