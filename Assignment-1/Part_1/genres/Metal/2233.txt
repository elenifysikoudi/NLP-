Cry away to heal Fly I want to flee Pride and self esteem I will sigh no more Pain is what i feel Help is what i need Please please stay with me I need your helping hand Hand I need your hand How could I believe Life only for me Now I'm alone Near dead end road Stare with empty eyes Sign of lifelessness Why I'm so weak Just let it all flow Denial Worst Enemy Lies have wounded me Love insanity Loss of hopes and dreams I just wanna live I just wanna live Denial Worst Enemy I just I just just wanna live I just I just just wanna live
