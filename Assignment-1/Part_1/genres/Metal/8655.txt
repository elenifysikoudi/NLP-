Learn from my sins The concept of our misery tried to the dreams day after day trying to escape this certain call to earth's embrace Another day lies another day dies Another day bleeding our time untold Another day lies another day cries Another day lies bleeding our time untold So strong was the bound To alters of eternity ade of cold stone But weak is our form cast in to the day by the will of God Burning my wings in the same fire from which I'm born to follow the light to follow myself burning my wings burning my fate wouldn't you like to know why the wings of life fade withered by our own tears burned by a faking grace A failed grace a failed grace
