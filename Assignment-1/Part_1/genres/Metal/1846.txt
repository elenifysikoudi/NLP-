I've got a secret My love my parasite I never gonna tell you So never ask me why It's hidden under my skin This deadly sin of mine Poison in my body Pleasure makes me blind My whole life is pain Because of this love It's my punishment Will never be enough Lie is its name Promises are mine I don't care now It leaves me as I die Because of this love I can't live my life Because of this love Can't find the way out
