RA take your glorious throne the weight of the heart you will behold schripture keeping come from thoth which weighs more the feather or the heart Heart is placed on a scale feather on the other side For every test that is passed the feather shows its decline Over the pale blue skies or one step closer to demise which is your destiny The spirit will surely see Forty two crimes are passed before your life He who reaches the other land shall exist like a god until the end weighing of the heart will you see the light weighing of the heart will your soul be ripped apart Over the pail blue skies or one step closer to demise which is your destiny The spirit shal surely see Beyond you do not go this time failed the worst of the crimes The entity does not proceed To the mansions of eternity As the shadow of death falls on your path is the gods halls Ammit will devour and slaughter Osirus start the next trial weighing of the heart will you see the light weighing of the heart will your soul be ripped apart
