Coming down from the mountain on high Towards the battle we go side by side Our hearts are filled with honour and pride Cause we know our time has come Silent voices down from below Rising up through the ice and the snow Ancient angers cast upon all Through the lands of the slain Through the dark night and through the rain Fighting machine we have risen again Stronger than all the world we arise Stand and fight join the light Into the battle with power and might Sound the guns raise the cannons of war With the North Star to guide us We ride on the sky Blazing up through the heavens Like eagles we fly And the horsemen shall come They will judge all your lives Revelations will now be unveiled Darkened night set to the swallow the light All is lost there's no one left to fight Overpowered by the glory and might Of the ones who stands tall Fallen heroes scattered around Deafened ears opens up to the sound Painful cries rising forever more From the victims of life and of war Through the dark night and through the rain Fighting machine we have risen again Stronger than all the world we arise Stand and fight join the light Into the battle with power and might Sound the guns raise the cannons of war With the North Star to guide us We ride on the sky Blazing up through the heavens Like eagles we fly And the horsemen shall come They will judge all your lives Revelations will now be unveiled No more hope of freedom Our dreams are washed away The second age is coming The dawn of a new day The judgement stands before us The second king will rise Our swords will shine with honour As hatred fills the skies With the North Star to guide us We ride on the sky Blazing up through the heavens Like eagles we fly And the horsemen shall come They will judge all your lives Revelations will now With the North Star to guide us We ride on the sky Blazing up through the heavens Like eagles we fly And the horsemen shall come They will judge all your lives Revelations will now Revelations will now Revelations will now be unveiled
