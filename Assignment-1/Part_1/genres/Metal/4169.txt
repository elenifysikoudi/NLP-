Fucked by Hecate Yet I shall not be yours No fantasies nor the promised grace I will chase you down Rid me of slavery Strengthen up my mind With a bliss from below Call me not never bow ye down honor Ride the southern blaze lighting up my throne See me star arise hear my nature's call I summon the beast call loud out its name Will never to fall yet to be restored Heal me not never bow ye down honor
