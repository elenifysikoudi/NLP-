"For so long I've been walking on the path of my life This way it hurts my feet but bravely I'm going on Straight ahead with no staff to support me Around me the landscape remains the same It used to please me it now turned grey Around me I see barriers to infinity I cannot escape my destiny A long time ago this way I've chosen Cause I couldn't cope with suffering A sign said ""Felicity at the end"" I started walking and now I'm going on For too long I've been walking on the path of my life On its sides bushes have turned into barb wire For too long I've been walking on the road of my faith It has now turned into the darkest corridor All I want is to fly away to leave this gloomy road I'm now waking up n'Don't want to follow it anymore But wings I don't own my salvation is lost As I'm used to I keep walking on and on As I reach the bottom of my doom A light appears and shines through the night This is not the end of my road it's another path It snakes away to another life For too long I've been walking on the path of my life Time has come to make the choice For too long I've been walking on the road of my faith Pray for me to do the best"
