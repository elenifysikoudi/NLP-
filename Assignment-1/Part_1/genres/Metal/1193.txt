I hate you I hate more everyday I'm sick of Watching you bullshit your way to the top You're a fake Beam of light to the lost No one sees it but me The words you preach The lessons you teach Aren't even your own There's no mind No heart No soul Nothing authentic involved Your fucking heads in the sky Your clothes are made of your lies But you wear them so proud You thought you had it all figured out I can see right through you I I hate hate What what You've become living a lie You call a life I hate you You've thrown more than you can change The hounds are waiting The hounds are waiting You thought you had it all figured out I can see right through you I I hate hate What what You've become living a lie You call a life fade Fake You fucking fake You fucking fake Fake You thought you had it all figured out We can see right through you I I hate hate What what You've become living a lie You call a life Fake I hate you I hate you Fake
