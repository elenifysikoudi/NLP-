my ways are scattered my life in pain my ways now others my heart drilled by pain my aways were like yours my life was like yours no day too long the world I was been was enough was enough emotions reflections tears will fall a pondering heart through my head I will stop the real a drift from above thousand thought waves are here for the crack they will it spite they never dwell I'll follow my way a Soul Massacre for the crack they will it spite they never dwell I'll follow my way a Soul Massacre a Soul Massacre for the cracked life I'll follow my way Soul Massacre for the crackes life I'll follow my way Soul Massacre Soul Massacre for the cracked life I'll follow my way Soul Massacre
