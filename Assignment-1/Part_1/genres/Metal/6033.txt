In everyone hides A king for a day Nature's actors In tragedies we play But deep bows the head That bears the crown For the weight of might Can always pull us down Pulls us down Soon my reign will end I a king without hands Soon this day will end As my tears descend Everyone has his own Dragons to slay Look in her eyes Never turn away Soon my reign will end I a king without hands Soon this day will end As my tears descend Every treasure you find And every road you take Has it's opposite side Sacrifices to make Dream on Sleep on Dream on Sleep on Time is my only fear An enemy of sand My dreams are old A new king will rise
