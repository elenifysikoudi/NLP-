With contrite hearts on the blackest of days We've done our deeds but now we have to pay The social call the presidents not home The gossip line we never would have known I awoke to the sound of singing in the streets The sorrow fell like the setting sun On dusty streets the sound of running in our heads As we hung like leaves from the trees Shooting from the hip we live our lives so precariously Breathing deeply for the last time I can see The lights shining just for me Built to last This winters going to end The sun will shine on our faces Life begins Swing low Sweet chariot Carry me home Ride till sunset leave it all behind and go Cowboys never die Built to last This winters going to end The sun will shine on our faces Life begins When life ends life begins Again and again
