you placed the sound of silence in my ears when i'm calm like sleeping underwater with dreams of you swirling around i'm engulfed don't let this fade away never let this go the storm above us is pounding ships are cracking at the hull under all this it's tranquil wrapped up in you breathe into me the breath life so i will never die again breathe into me the breath life so i will never die again and i will rise to the surface trying to swim against the beating waves i slip and fall the water pounding in my lungs the fear of failing pulls me it marks my demise like salt in open wounds light burns my sun baked eyes the sound of silence in my head solace is found in silent conversation you speak without using your words solace is found in silent conversation thoughts are carried up on angels wings words speak volumes when they are unspoken my head is mute but my heart still sings you bought me you brought me out thoughts are carried up on angels wings take me away solace is found in this silence breathe into me my father breathe into me my friend take some time to listen to me please hear me out i can't let you go that way take some time to listen to me please hear me out i can't let you go that way look into his eyes and tell him he's not wanted look into his eyes and tell him he is not your friend
