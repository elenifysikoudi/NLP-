oh my interest oh my loveless curiosity oh my toothache oh my basement what they mean to me all signs said that i'd been busted my circle was tired and rusted i was hoping for at least an argument my sentimental hand has fought with my chains and got right to the heart of it maybe this was meant for me i ate the silver lining off i didn't always need you both times i was overwhelmed both hands made room for me the new spirit of place not body was my anniversary so i'll blink slowly so i don't notice i fought with your handprints and got right to the heart of it maybe this was meant for me i cut the silver lining off i didn't always love you i drink tears and i get right to the heart of it maybe this was meant for me i ripped the silver lining off i didn't always i split quick and that was only two days a small drink to make sense of the thruway my tomorrow is rarely a new day i run it off
