I hear a distant thunder They say thou don't surrender Witnessing lael my eyes the sins of our land Why can't we see from under Dark reign on thou defenders Endlessly torturing the sons without stand Fight out lets break the chains So strong we must feel no pain Forever torn apart from the haunting fields of man Raging fear from skies above the fire fill my veins Destruction of humanity the everlasting flame Cast away no turning back from long and darkened shore We'll show no mercy as they fall The fire burns inside Now prepare for war You feel the pain no longer Daylight your heart grows stronger Not even sense the burning hunger inside Ride out with force and valour in memory forever Towards the battering and rise all the time Stand out we'll break the chain in unity we feel no pain Forever torn apart from the haunting fields of man Raging fear from skies above the fire fills my veins Destruction of humanity the everlasting flame Cast way no turning back from long and darkened shore We'll show no mercy as they fall the fire burns inside Now prepare for war Looking around there's no fear in your heart for I know you will never surrender Everyone here raise there eyes to the sky now we strike out and onward we fight Prepare for war Raging fear from skies above the fire fill my veins Destruction of humanity the everlasting flame Raging fears from skies above the fire fills my veins Destruction of humanity the everlasting flame Cast away no turning back from land and darkened shore We'll show no mercy as they fall We'll show no mercy standing tall Till becomes us we won't fall The fire burns inside Now prepare for war War
