Strangers they come with the rise of the sun To escape from this madness forever Rivers will dry bringing holes in the sky As the empire is fading away Silently watch now and the lost souls run wild In a time long forgotten forever Hate brings us sadness and the dawn of the world But this nightmare will still carry on Through the day we'll find a way we're lost beneath the stars Faceless they follow and we all stand as one Long wasted tears but the laugh forever shining One stand one last command to end it all Outside the world in a fallen land turn away from my despair We stand alone in a silent dream lost within eternity Rise again and try to understand The light for the world will save us tonight Redemption still so far away Marching on inside of our loneliness Still searching for all that remains And time pass me by The light not so far away Will the sons of the night now our blood runs into the ocean Tomorrow we're gone our souls rising up to the sun The light for the world will save us tonight Redemption still so far away Marching on inside of our loneliness Still searching for all that remains It's just one wasted life in one wasted land Suffering so far and so alive It's just one wasted man in one wasted land Until the end of time Inside the winter storm Outside the world in a fallen land turn away from my despair We stand alone in a silent dream lost within eternity Rise again and try to understand The light for the world will save us tonight Redemption still so far away Marching on inside of our loneliness Still searching for all that remains It's just one wasted man in one wasted land Suffering so far and so alive It's just one wasted man in one wasted land Until the end of time Inside the winter storm Inside the winter storm
