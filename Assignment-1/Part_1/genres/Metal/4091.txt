Delightful night When the full moon lights cemetery's valley Winds of frost strike my tomb When I am in eternal sleep When wild storms dwell Wind blows through the Baltic Instincts unleash the war inside And strike the sky with Holocaust thunder Mountains sleep the forest Covers freezing land where I was born Now I walk among the castles Watch the streams of frozen tears Spilled with blood of forefathers Night breeze feed my spiritual form And spirits gather floating in the mist My eastern empires spread wings of winter Visions of destruction's ruin and tragedies Tasting pure sin fade into the pit And walk through my beloved endless woods I summon all the beauty Evil To rape the bodies of your disciples Too long I hide in shades of woods And now I build my beauty Hall Wallachian tyrant I bring a winter I come with frost and burning hate Follow the gods of eastern lands Being the battle which blows the earth
