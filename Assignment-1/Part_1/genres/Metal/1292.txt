Let the light shine in Cause We're not alone We're Not Alone Let the light shine in Cause We're not Alone We're Not Alone We will tear away We will tear away This awful feeling lets start the bleeding We will wash away We will wash away All of Your doubt This will be the last time that You're never going to hurt again I'll never sing this song without you Without you Remember the way that it felt You're never going to hurt again I'll never sing this song Remember the day Remember Hide your makeshift hearts We're taken aim We're taken aim And We won't be leaving Hide your Makeshift hearts We're taken aim taken aim We won't be leaving We will tear away We will tear away This awful feeling lets start the bleeding We will wash away We will wash away All of Your doubt This will be the last time that You're never going to hurt again I'll never sing this song without you Without you Remember the way that it felt You're never going to hurt again I'll never sing this song Remember the day Remember Let your light shine in tonight tonight tonight All alone is where we've been before All alone is where we started All alone is where we've been before All alone is where we started All alone is where we've been before All alone is where we started All alone is where we've been before All alone is where we started We'll be testing the martyrs We'll be testing the martyrs And bringing hell and high waters And bringing hell and high waters We'll be testing the martyrs We'll be testing the martyrs And bringing hell and high waters And bringing hell and high waters
