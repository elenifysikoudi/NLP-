From the top of the highest mountain Prior to descent my fall for Thee My weapon is silence I bringer of light To burn this goddamn Eden down Behold I rise from primal silence As a storm crushing dismal shores of Acheron My weapon is violence from the mud of the earth Back to the womb of Babylon Sink in the stream of woe Acheron Rise above the eyes of God Necromanteion I am the oracle I am the grace of god I am the stream of woe I am wrath from above From Neptunian realm arisen Babylon the great I praised With the voice of silence I called the genii Of the heights and depths I came down as raging Mars As volcanic fire god Totality and I are one In the absence of light Infinite I shall become Sink in the stream of woe Acheron Rise above the eyes of god Necromanteion Sink in the stream of woe Acheron Rise above the eyes of god Necromanteion
