I don't know who you are I don't know when you slipped inside of me you possessed my life you hurt me deep inside years that passed by pure energy is lost lost so far lost I want to say you it's mine my own life controls me not you not those ones a plot against of my own a challenge for me and my inner strength falling without reason wake me up and stop me when it comes falling without reason break out as far as you can as you can I don't know who you are I don't know when you slipped inside of me just why did you choose me to be your captive or companion show me your face I want to see to understand this fault of my past falling without reason wake me up and stop me when it comes falling without reason break out as far as you can falling without reason falling without reason this period of time I won't forget I won't forget
