Stumbling through This complex puzzle that is my life Thirsty for knowledge But drinking from poisoned fountains Flashbacks from my past God knows how long I'll last Images of you Leading my soul astray These four walls Are closing in suffocating me My last wish is to Transcend from this dimension of boredom Wrap your arms around me Like a circle around the sun I loved you so Why couldn't you love me Chorus EUREKA I found the secret of life EUREKA
