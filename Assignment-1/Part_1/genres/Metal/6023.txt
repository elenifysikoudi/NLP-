I see your eyes Blue and wide open Take your time my divine creature My arms will provide undivided attention Sleep child sleep rest your eyes until the sun comes up and you'll awake to light everyones day up again Rest your head in my lap honey The day I wept is when I had you my love Sleep child sleep rest your eyes until the sun comes up and you'll awake to light everyones day up again
