An angel of exile Slave to the betrayed Beware of those who collect feathers Fury of a mob raised by the horns of indecency Crawling as knives are lain on your back In heaven the sounds of freedom are dorwned for choice Hell born Rising phoenix from this great void greater laws of man The unforeseen trail of the gods in theory of rage Reaching out to these knives Grabbing at all blades I've bitten the hand that feeds me I've embraced the hand that deceives me The Judas Kiss Following of the second fault of man Falling altar of Christ This betrayer in the choices of life Treachery in the fall of supreme These thrones of decay still stand unbroken Relics of the condemned hand Feeding the feeble History of the forgotten stigmas that men fear Transparent soul of the insecure one Just like lying alone as water fills the lungs No hands to reach for when all is deceit Within the soul of burning defeat These souls Forged in flame These souls The pathway of untruth These sou ls Forgotten in shame These souls Create curse in eternity One among many I am alone Time decayed words of promise Harsh in beauty Darkness pains me A brotherhood of unbroken loyalty As the sounds of these nails being struck disrupts the winds Passion of enrapture in rage Balance of the grave Starving soul With ashes and dust These dead roses for the nameless Take me Into the mouth of decay
