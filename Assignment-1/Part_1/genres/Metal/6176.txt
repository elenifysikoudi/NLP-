Blindly walking against the outcomes of life Hallowed The kiss of decay in steps of two Empty bleak carrion Stripped of sensation Exposing the faith of beyond on your deathbed We are but worms in the fruit of expiration The most forbidden fruit of disease Unkept from dying Lost within a distand fear Distant feat of dying This idol of absolute Animals of the world feed war Pathological outcast of Christ Taking revolution for name Glassy look of the eyes Too deep for a living soul to stomach Images of the afterworld Leverage within the creation of ruin We travel through a doorway of nothing Enter afterlife of inverted faith Indulging in childhood fears To enter a mystery of ungodly ascent Ascend The never ending punishment of unfeeling to perish in a death of disregard Oppressive association in a vague cleansing of the irate Gold gates of the divine Breathe more life into vanity Material power Human idealism A living myth of the trials of the abnormal Winged ugli ness in a shattered prism Soaring the scaled impiety to lay the trap With fruit of failure It leads our rebirth into the snake The darkness bleeds throughout the sky in plagues A deep breath of a martyr's dream Scorn of emptiness to be embraced in solitude Inhale this freedom Justify our existence
