Ravens over battlefield are marking the chosen Brave northern warriors to their last fight Shield maidens ride the wolves in the sky with ravens Scouting the battleground for souls of slain heroes Choosers of slain Valkyries ride through the night sky Singing fierce battle cries Valkyries choosers of slain Come ride their wolves Howling wolves in the night carrying female deities Escort the dead warriors to Odin's hall Armour of Valkyries flashes up over the skies Shading a strange light the northern lights Choosers of slain Valkyries ride through the night sky Singing fierce battle cries Valkyries choosers of slain Come ride their wolves
