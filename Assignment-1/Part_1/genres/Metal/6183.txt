As this dark sun prepares its wrath in a form of black plagues Manifest the steel flame from the manuscript of blame Conjuring of Golgotha to find the outcast grave The curse of the nails that impaled this soul of disease Exhaling these locust swarms within the exorcist entombed Scars from the skies as hell crawls from this oblivion This funeral dirge as trumpets sound the Armageddon The blind child with the divine eye Carried along like dead young from the holocaust Mother blinded by birth of love Even as death rots its stench The heretic wears the crown Sanitarium for the mental failure The baring of three crosses A birth of primates in acceptance of faith Savior in a scientific thesis Hail Mary Uplifting the weight Trail of choices to end your fate Concrete ideas of hatred break Bury this burden of this choice to make Soiled from filth of acceptance Unlove of a pagan scapegrace Finding fear in the great beyond Left to scream in a cold alone As I call the storms of hallowed winds Upon the earth Come to me Oh Mother night What woes do you hold for me Angels of doomed destiny return to fire Indecency never to be held in grace of good Decline to the lower world Descend into the flame Blind eyes of the burnt dead The final sentence by the judge of the dead placed Drowning in the river of passage to the mortal world Requiem for the demise of Asgard The whore lays with deception of touch Followers embracing the whisper of a silenced dying breath Ignite the hand of glory Five flames Poisoning the masses A plague will follow curiosity of Pandora's Box Rendered a kiss of shame Transvection beyond the light Nail driving plagues Exorcism swarm Storm raising Splinters upon the cross All lives lost
