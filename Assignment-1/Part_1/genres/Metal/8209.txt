The gloomy shadow in screams Embrace the multicolor scenes The mirages of hypocrite souls In all these years the lost years Beneath the crystal brightness Of the circle of dimensions I see the end of my earthly life I founded the unreal past I'm searching the serenity To fill the void that flows in me Deliverance of the humilliated man Strange times are coming I proclaim this soul as wraith My dismal eyes are blinded Emotions lead my journey the dawn now is here Dust dust in my sky cold cold is my life Crawling in cosmic solitude Somber remembrance of the forest The lunatic visions of my life I whisper as I fly poor ignorant entities Now I'll go to my place Awaiting for the end of this life The macrocosmos is open to me The stars will be my guide Universal path of disgrace
