Vortex motion be my temper I can feel them coming closer Cosmic hunters chose their victim Close to the trap where I am in Danger for the chaos system Coming closer I can feel them Liquid noise sounds so inhuman Whispering outer space anthem I'm a castaway That's not my place to stay I wanna find my Home where I'm from Help me fly away Starring eyes I can't wait longer I can feel them coming closer Increasing light shows when I turn Open mind blurred body pattern
