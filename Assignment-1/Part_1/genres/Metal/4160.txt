For ages travelled by the holy fire Today free free and triumphant To no avail for the dungeons and chains of the inquisition Poor and lonely are my adversers Who serving the beast for million years With the whip and crown of thorns Shall be remunerated today Wanderer perpetual and restless Master equally hideous beautiful Loved and adored How simple it is For many years my semen hath envenomed the races Abomination to the earthly to everything that is simple And obscure at the same time Therefore let us celebrate the antitesis of the eucharist With the sacerdoral gesture you welcome us I am your dazing threshold Let us commence We are void of our bodies The night that we are honoured to celebrate Perhaps the last during which I satisfy my desire Wanderer perpetual and restless Master equally hideous beautiful The real world or the imaginary vision Still perceptible to my chaotic thoughts Nothing shall taste the same again I am waiting for you to stab the world in its heart
