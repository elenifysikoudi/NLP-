Open heaven I see the glorious everlasting Open heaven Before my eyes there is glory passing It's what the rocks shout and the stars speak Only one God reigns This is the day when heaven and earth meet Only one God reigns All creation knows his name and now I stand before him All creation knows his name and every heart adores him With eyes that burn like fire I found hope for the hopeless men I see heaven open wide so let the hope arise again With eyes that burn like fire I found hope for the hopeless men I see heaven open wide so let the hope arise again Even death has to bow down At the throne of the king All hell has to bow down Every nation will sing There is only one who is worthy Every nation will sing There is only one who is worthy I would give everything No matter what the cost I will follow him No matter what the cost I will follow him To seek and save the lost I will follow him God has come to his people God has come to this land So let hope arise again With eyes that burn like fire I found hope for the hopeless men I see heaven open wide so let the hope arise again With eyes that burn like fire I found hope for the hopeless men I see heaven open wide so let the hope arise again It's what the rocks shout and the stars speak Only one God reigns This is the day when heaven and earth meet Only one God reigns All creation knows his name and now I stand before him All creation knows his name and every heart adores him I walk the narrow road And follow the one that can set me free I never have to walk alone This is my destiny I've found something worth dying for
