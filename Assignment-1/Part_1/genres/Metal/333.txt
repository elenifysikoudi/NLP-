A Dying Skyline Cold From Wind And Rain Autumn Of Darkness End In Fire And Flames North Blows The Wind And My Sight Is Afar Along The Coming Of The Northern Stars Fires Burnt Under These Skies Here Ancient Norsemen Once Brought Us To Pride A Heathen Force Is To Rise On These Days The Sun Still Fanding Soon Clouds Of Black Rage We're All Blackened Skies We're All Blackened Skies We're Under All Blackened Skies The Heir Of Gods To Arise We're Under All Blckened Skies The Heir Of Our Ancient Pride We're All Blackened Skies We're All Blackened Skies We're All Blackened Skies We're All Blackened Skies
