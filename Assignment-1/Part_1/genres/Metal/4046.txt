Running trough the battlefield I hear a voice in my head I see a man behind the shield My head's a mess different voices tell that I Should leave and be a great man But should I stay and be a warrior Like my father He is fighting for this land I must stay I must leave I don't know gods help me please Fly alone To a place where you can be a warrior Fly alone To a place where you can be a hero It's a place far away you must leave You cannot stay spread your wings and fly away from home Again I hear a voice I in my head I see a battleship abandoned it's a head That voice in my head tells I should leave I go to the ship my destiny is here Like my father He's fighting for his land But I must leave I must go I don't know Voice told me so Fly alone To a place where you can be a warrior Fly alone To a place where you can be a hero It's a place far away you must leave You cannot stay spread your wings and fly away from home I'm fighting for my land With this sword in my hand Killing enemies they fall one by one Blood everyewhere guts and bodies Battle rages on what's that That's my son Those bastards they won't take my son I see Edel in that window That ship is going I must stop them from leaving My son is in there I want to keep my son I want to make him a warrior I want to hold my son I want to make him a hero To fight for the good To fight proudly by my side Protecting this world And stones with sword in his hand I want to keep my son But soon he will be gone I have to stop that ship Or I will never see my son The ship is leaving I have to run and try to stop it go I won't let the enemy I won't let the enemy take my son Oh please gods help now They try to steal my only one The ship is leaving I want to keep my son I want to make him a warrior I want to hold my son I want to make him a hero To fight for the good To fight proudly by my side Protecting this world And stones with sword in his hand I want to keep my son But soon he will be gone I have to stop that ship Or I will never see my son As the battle rages on I rode trough it like the wind Now gates of Sendell lie before me Still they fighting for the stones Those are kept inside these walls But I'm only worried about my son The final enemy meet my sword Just before the gates of the fortress I see the enemies they're still trying But I have to see my wife Oh please gods give me streght Now I'm entering the gates Running up the stairs to my room What is this I see No Few hours ago So Shemin just told Edel pushed her to the floor And then run out from the door Now I have found seed of darkness he is bound There's no cure for my son Or for plague that they have done Years ago so I've been told That the blood of our enemies was put into our souls Now I have found seed of darkness we are bound There's no cure for my son or for plaguethat they have done And for me everything is gone What happened Please don't die They took our son No they didn't take him Edel took the stones himself And left
