Silently marching our quest for revenge Lost in the forgotten tragedy Scars of the past still alive in our veins Onwards we fight to our destiny Trample their forces we now overrun Sign of the power inside of us Cities in ruins and lives are destroyed Stand at the edge of the universe Suffering fills the open sky Battering down the pain inside Memories hide the moonlight sky Till the end of our days Conquering lands and fallen heroes Sanity torn we ride on fearless Victory sounds a thousand miles away Into this world in wonder from a starlight sky For a lifetime of freedom and the legend is born Once more unbroken the price we will pay On this march into fire the heart of the storm Endless destruction consuming our land Legions of darkness destroy mankind Storming the wasteland we now overcome Vanquishing evil insane we find Rise of the slain breaking the chains Fight through the whirlwind of doom Live for the day conquer the pain Under the light of the moon Into this world in wonder from a starlight sky For a lifetime of freedom and the legend is born Once more unbroken the price we will pay On this march into fire the heart of the storm Outside the endless rain Crushed by the burning pain This life goes on forever after Across the universe on through the twilight sky And still we feel the fire go on and on Into this world in wonder from a starlight sky For a lifetime of freedom and the legend is born Once more unbroken the price we will pay On this march into fire the heart of the storm
