Highway of emptiness outside the burning world Rise again this quest for our salvation Running faster the savage laughter the daylight fades away Nothing left but the life we left behind Ever searching the hidden faces the inside Broken by down the fire below destroyed Light years away actuals between us So eternal wait say goodbye for the last time tonight Still lost within the lonely distant lifetime ago Hanging on as we pass through the fields These pieces of our lives will lead the long journey home And alone stand the hills So fly for the last time and the fire burns within Silently we stand in a long forgotten wasteland Rise through the lost ages hope they will bring Free forever more and the dream will never die Devil's station the lost connection the beatdown man returns So confused and alone for one more time Crush defeated the force surround me the prisoner trapped inside System down field with intimate tonight Time after time promises of freedom We'll leave the past behind and strike for the first time tonight Still mystified my life all creation they show After all of the tries we've been through These memories and empty words were all lost in vain And the scars never heal Whoa oh oh And the dream will never die
