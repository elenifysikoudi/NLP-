"Christians oh how I hate them all I see them as weaklings who care about all Misery where ever it dwells There they are with their smiles Trying to help Hurt them and they turn the other cheek If you confront me You will repent I don't even bother About other's problem Don't care about humanity I only care about me Over and over they speak of their lies Over the weak ones they gather like flies What's wrong with people why don't they see What they are preaching is hypocrisy You mother fuckers ""Speak to me about your lies And I will rip out your fucking tongue"" ""If you face me with your idiot smile I will wet my fucking steel"" I don't even bother About the other's problem I don't care about humanity Oh god I hate you Over and over they speak of their lies Over the weak ones they gather like flies What's wrong with people why don't they see What they are preaching is hypocrisy Hypocrisy Over and over they speak of their lies Over the weak ones they gather like flies What's wrong with people why don't they see What they are preaching is hypocrisy "
