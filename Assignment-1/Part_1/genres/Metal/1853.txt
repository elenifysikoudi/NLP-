Once we'll meet in a dark cold room Where the walls are bloody red Once I'll be as strong as you You will feel my breath of death You'll know my name from a place You'll remember my face no more I will ask you something God What you'll never let me know Something I wanted something more Anything I'm so scarred alone I take from you something and give you What you'd never ask for I show you the way you respected The true faith I was living for
