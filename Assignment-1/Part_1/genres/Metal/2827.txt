1 The Arrival Of Eternity 2 End My Pain Time has taken it's toll Years passed by like a storm Cold burning inside I'm not the same I've changed my ways Dawn hunting my dreams Fear silent I scream Pain growing inside I'm not the same I've found my way Nothing is the same anymore The times have changed I feel so cold Hate is ripping my guts Light is blinding my eyes Fools spare me your lies my ears are deaf My mind is black God where is your god Pain there's my god Death come for me now end my pain Show me the way Everytime everywhere Everdawn everfear Nothing more nothing less All is done all is said
