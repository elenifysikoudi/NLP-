I don't need you to understand me DON'T NEED AT ALL I don't need you to ask me questions You'd not believe a word I know long ago You have sold your soul You don't need a word to say DON'T NEED AT ALL I don't need you to like me DON'T NEED AT ALL I don't need you to search for me And take my hand no more I know long ago You have sold your soul You don't need a word to say DON'T NEED AT ALL I don't need you to feel regret DON'T NEED AT ALL I don't need you to cry That lying tears no more I know long ago You have sold your soul You don't need more word to say DON'T NEED AT ALL
