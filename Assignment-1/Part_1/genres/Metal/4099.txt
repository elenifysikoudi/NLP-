I've seen strange signs on my way Silent shadows Dancing shapes And angels fallen on the earth Face up And look here When the root of thy cannot reach Art thou Nephilim child Are ye looking for thy Elysium Here among the living trees Among the fading stars Varibility ov forms Sometimes love Sometimes sadness ov things Sometimes rapture and wine o sabbath Sometimes hatred divine rage And 93 rears no limit Beyond the sin gilgolem Ye taught me the secret words IOA SABAO Protect thy Daimon Why why whisper thoughts But might is raised When conjurer of seasons Hums the song sorrowful joyful Night is eternal And day is eternal With runes ov life And runes ov death As above so below Now it's time ov the beast
