Confidence and hope I'm looking forward to future plans Not able to realize yet Makes me wanna take a rope or swallow some pills any time But let's have a look In the distance I see light Gives me satisfaction Keeps me hangin on When stability is gone I take my own life I make the decisions I have a goal That's worth living Confidence in what I do realising my hope That's the bright side I'm looking for But I know how to take it In times when my life looks shattered and I'm not feeling to well Confused when I think Which direction not for sure Dreams far away Time doesn't seem to go on
