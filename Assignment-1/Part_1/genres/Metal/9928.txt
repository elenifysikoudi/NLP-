Breathing life into these mares where enemies turn into flesh This is the abyss I fear the most I feel their eyes staring at me Waiting with carnivorous patience their memory timeless For all they know i must succumb sometime A solemn cry rises to the sky as heavy wings blacken out The morning sun with infinite darkness Am I dreaming or am I dead In search for my heart lost in this hell The vultures are soaring above tearing me apart Screaming voices in my head A sudden pain then deadly silence Devouring the remains of my heart I can feel it dying Picking at the bones of my soul Left me dead inside The more I gave the more they took Left me dead inside
