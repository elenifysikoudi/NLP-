Condemned return of the crowned one Homicide of the first son Continuous trial of the forsaken Bleeding these sores Deformity of this new cult The inbred rising against the bastard law As the visual perversion of Christ sits between eyes of the judged Masturbate the embrace of dark Urine burns the eyes of the unconverted Harvesting the knowledge of putried elegance The broken crest Evolve as the squandered birth Brittle in poise To once again nourish from this embraced death Slaughtering these plagues Of the Holy Catastrophic profit Of unkempt dignity Enter this holocaust of the free Bring us justification for vengeance Destroyer of the sick accuser The sky denied Strangling the swan of starvation As birth covers the floor of the church Carnivorous grave worms hanging from hooks Devouring the gray matter of emotion I hear the salvation of Hell calling Hell calling One more dead One more lost in a plagued existence PLagued existence The chalice that bleeds youth for all The bone of wrath that breaks all will Unproficized legion Feeling the eclipse of portals Wage your war on sin The war between the lack of it will be you who casts the first stone Blind oblivion is just the beginning
