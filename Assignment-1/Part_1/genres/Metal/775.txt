Sometimes at night I feel them Waiting for the dawn I hear them call out to me no one do I see I wander alone through the rain Drifting I hear them calling This time there's no uncertainty From the depths below Where only demons dare to go Resonates the unseen force Rising through the fragile core After the rain comes crashing down Who will be left to sing the songs And when the new day has begun who'll wipe the tears away After the rain comes crashing down There's no one left to carry on And then the bells begin to chime For whom it tolls tonight Silently I slip into their lair Never a doubt as I see the despair I sense it everywhere Now I know what must be done I take a final look and then I'm gone My story will live forever on From the depths below Where only demons dare to go Resonates the unseen force Rising through the fragile core After the rain comes crashing down Who will be left to sing the songs And when the new day has begun who'll wipe the tears away After the rain comes crashing down There's no one left to carry on And then the bells begin to chime For whom it tolls tonight From far away they came to elighten us Offering to change the ways That have led us down the road to rein
