Can you imagine that it's all up to you Evil embrace of powers unnatural You're left in silence nothing more to behold You close your eyes and visualize an evil getaway It's here it's near I see it all so clear Tonight your flight will take you higher It's here it's near You live a life of fear Tonight's the night that will inspire Crying alone at night your destiny unknown Your every being full of rage and hate Seems like you're running but you just can not hide It's your raging fear of solitude that's left behind It's here it's near I see it all so clear Tonight your flight will take you higher It's here it's near You live a life of fear Tonight's the night that will inspire Can he comfort thee And fill your life with ecstasy Through the darkness and the pain Will you be there once again Disciples of Babylon Yeah yeah It's here it's near I see it all so clear Tonight your flight will take you higher It's here it's near You live a life of fear Tonight's the night that will inspire Can he comfort thee Fill your life with ecstasy Through the darkness and the pain Will you be there once again Disciples of Babylon It's here it's near I see it all so clear Tonight your flight will take you higher It's here it's near You live a life of fear Tonight's the night that will inspire Can he comfort thee Fill your life with ecstasy Through the darkness and the pain Will you be there once again Disciples of Babylon
