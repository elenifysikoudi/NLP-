Why do you look at me if you hate me When I see your disgust I go crazy 'cause you can't see what's in my brain and I don't have any disease in my vein You condemn me without knowing me Because of formalities I'm your enemy I just don't want to understand Why am I worst when I'm different I live my life how I want it My way I don't give a fuck if you don't like it My way Just hate me I don't give a damn shit My way You can't see what's in me so I don't care what you say Don't want to tell me who I have to be Just look at your own life and let me be who I am there's a lot of bigger problem Leave me alone and concentrate on them You waste your time with things of no importance And forget easy what's the real substance Don't fuck with me and don't see my aim You play yours and I play my game My way
