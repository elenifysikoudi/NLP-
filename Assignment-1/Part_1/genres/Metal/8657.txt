loneliness is holding my life please give me reason why I find this hue in your glance but still I fear to look in your eyes while the dusk tints your smile with the gold of the night I try but I can't feign delight please give me the reason why I've been wondering round but still I look back for you while my thoughts wait in seas traced with the gold in the night hear my hear my heart In this in this night while the dusk tints your smile with the gold of the night
