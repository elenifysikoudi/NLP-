"My visions are all clouded I see nothing but red This hatred has now congealed to a near climatic state Why do I remain here to weaken through the years I am so confused my soul dies all the while I don't wish to co exist with this feeble human race I don't feel the need to be infected with the disease called ""life"" A state of mental grief causes my mind great pain In this emotional state I suffer from despondency Violent and murderous thoughts Form deep inside my mind Dwelling on these sights to the point where I'm insane Why do I remain alive when I only wish to die I am so distressed my soul rots all the while I'm surrounded by life loving shapes that exist without a choice Your fears of death are covered up by the words ""Suicide is weak"" Released from the grip of life's burdening chains My body devoid of blood and unable to embrace pain With death I'll grow in strength and might Fading away without remorse With death I'll leave this weakened earth To become at one with the night With death I'll grow in strength and might Fading away without remorse With death I'll leave this weakened earth I am at one with the night"
