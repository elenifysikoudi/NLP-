In plastic world a new day You don't wanna see Its reality you must feel The taste of the filth It's in your mouth Deep under your skin These are broken worms Try to grasp them It must burn and hurt cause that pain You're lying into the faces You're smiling in the mirror You give a faith an idol Devices in the hard of the terror Dirty dignity surface Just scream of a slave Just spies in the whole life Stupid self break Supplication imploring hands There's nothing to help It isn't worth it to worry about someone else
