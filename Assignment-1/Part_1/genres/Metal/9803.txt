As the sun falls behind the sea we lay in our beds Wrestling quarreling with the questions in our heads Fear pillages and rapes my mind I see it looking over me Feel the fear the fear of failure Feel the fear of emptiness Feel the fear of a promised death Hanging over our heads Feel the fear of it all crashing down Feel the fear feel the fear feel the fear Trudging toiling looking for some hope And in time well know Finding no rest more sleepless nights Holding tight to the comforts of your wasted life Shed your fear what is the cost of living Shed your fear will you pay the price Remove the earth digging for truth Quest for a calling to ransom back the dead Seeking the truth inside reaching for a bloodied hand Shed the fear condemned to a martyrs death I would gladly lose my life for the sake of Jesus Christ Hear me now if this be my final hour Hear me now if this be my final hour Hear me now hear me now if this be my final hour With my last breath No more fear no more emptiness left in here No more fear I shed the fear of a promised death
