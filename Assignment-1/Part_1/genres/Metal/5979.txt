I feel it slip Slip away From my hands All the away My heart pounds like mad I feel it slip Slip away Why am I Why am I here So distant from My old life My heart feels so sad What am I Doing here You see I'm riding endlessly What will become of me This higher power knows You see I'm waiting patiently And what this means to me Nobody ever knows You see In all the warmth I feel Is this the end of me Only i should know
