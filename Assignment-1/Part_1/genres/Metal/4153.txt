One eyed old man I am Yet I possess the knowledge of thousand sages An unborn child I am Though I have existed for billion years The invisible army I am Though the won battle still to come The father of ambitious and dissapointed I am Brother in sin and abasement I was Judas in your dream Who worshipped money above all I was the roman warrior Who wounded you and drank the divine blood I was pilate on your trial Who spat in your pale face Each thorn was a sinful spell Each nail the fulfillment of the revenge For which I have been waiting for so many years Hatred for thousand holy heads And also that many daggers pointed at their visages The fallen angels mythical daemons Thriumphant in their blasphemy I am Gordon my name is annihilation Extremination I am the thousand plagues and afflictions
