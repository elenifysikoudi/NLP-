"Father I call your name upon the furious winds I'm possessed by the spiritual strength of hell In the chamber of my dark heart a black flame burns Satan I summon the horned one from the abyssmal kingdom Grant me the darkened unholy power To please my evil wicked lust Whispering forbidden names upon the skies Guide me through the pathways to a kingdom of fire Nightfall embreces my desperate cries As I fulfill my dark desires The converted hour has finally arrived The year when darkness over skies descends When lightning strikes the highest mountain And open up the path to the forbidden hades My dark desires My dark desires My dark desires My dark desires Satan take my soul to hell I must burn in the unholy flames Satan take my soul to hell I must burn to purify my weak soul Father I call your name upon the furious winds I'm possessed by the spiritual strength of hell In the chamber of my dark heart a black flame burns Satan I summon the horned one from the abyssmal kingdom Grant me the darkened unholy power To please my evil wicked lust Whispering forbidden names upon the skies Guide me through the pathways to a kingdom of fire Nightfall embreces my desperate cries As I fulfill my dark desires ""If I start murdering people there would be non of you left"" Bring damnation upon my soul My dark desires My dark desires My dark desires My dark desires"
