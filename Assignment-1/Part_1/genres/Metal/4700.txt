the morning was a ball of fire extinguished by the leaking moon the morning was beautiful just like the bodies laying out in the yard i know what we put our faith into yeah i really knew and so do you and i've grown into a dutiful lying man and i think it through and so do you who am i attempting to lose when i walk into the fog god forbid i'd have seen it cause i did it for myself bought into the promise and i did it for myself satan lift me up cause i did it for myself rip up the bone and put it on my shelf and i hardly know with this abated article and i understand that i've been your man for way too long for way too long blinking eye crucify me with nervous lullabies punish me violently free my broken family god forbid i'd have seen it cause i did it for myself bought into the promise and i did it for myself satan lift me up cause i did it for myself ripped up the bone and put it on my shelf my split bottom lip i put it on my shelf a statue of my father i put it on my shelf my woman's bottom dollar i put it on my shelf
