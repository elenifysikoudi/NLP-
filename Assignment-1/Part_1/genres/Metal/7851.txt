When the moonlight rays awakens me I rise from my grave In the hunt for fresh blood I fly through the night sky Carried by the winds and everywhere I go Death will follow Eternal bloodlust a soul condemned by god Cursed to live forever entire and intact To forever walk the path of loneliness And the only shelter provided by shadows Provided by shadows With me comes horror With me comes death With me comes pain A soul that never rest How I want peace Grant me the eternal sleep To stay in my grave To the end of days Please let me rot This nightmare must stop Enter my kingdom a dreamland of hate Here is so cold Always surrounded by death never see the rise of dawn Only the light of the moon to feed on the mortals Forever I'm doomed I'm the king of nocturnal Never rest in a tomb With me comes horror With me comes death With me comes pain A soul that never rest Eternal bloodlust a soul condemned by god Cursed to live forever I am immortal To forever walk the path of loneliness And the only shelter provided by shadows Shelter of shadows With me comes horror With me comes death With me comes pain A soul that never rest How I want peace Grant me the eternal sleep To stay in my grave To the end of days Please let me rot This nightmare must stop
