Emptiness is here No control losing all sight of hope One thing that I see My image is staring back at me One trip over the sun Starlight Days will carry on While we search for starlight Days will carry on While we search forDarkness reappears You are lost and the body fills with fear Look to the light we'll know and we'll learn From wrong and right One trip over the sun Starlight Days will carry on with time While we search for starlight Days will carry on While we search for I'll stay awake tonight floating in nothing Starlight Days will carry on with time While we search for starlight Days will carry on with time While we search for starlight
