What is the reason God blessed me with sight And shows me these signs in the sky Where my observations are now leading me I am just so afraid to describe My certainty The center of the universe is the earth The Holy Father has decreed But I believe this heliocentric truth Will they burn me for what I believe In holy flame be purified In holy flame How can all this be offensive to God Who created all that I see How can I deny what I know to be real Will they burn me for what I believe In holy flame be purified Injuring the holy faith with my blasphemy I will face torment and I will taste pain I will be purified in holy flames I pray for my salvation Offending the Holy Church with my heresy Before this court and before Holy God I beg for mercy please forgive my sin I pray for salvation This fact cannot be disputed The center of all creation is here No debating and no discovery Pray for my salvation I abjure curse and detest all my errors They are contrary to the Holy Scriptures I recant for everything I have said Pray for my salvation In holy flames I'll be purified And so we turn And so we turn Turning in a circle in a circle round the sun
