This dominion has been ruled to long by those known as Hyksos and I Komose prince of Thebes Vow to destroy to the utmost Thus my armies of upper Egypt shall sail upon the great Nile For all the years of oppression and cruelty their souls soon shall fly Fly To heavens skies Fly Spirits rise With my legions before me like a fiery flame in the nigh A Hyksos vessel commands a force and confront us by the break of light Upon them like a hawk I close in Lions feasting on their prey We continue to destroy on throughout until mid day Take slaves for our use years of abuse War goes on for weeks Their armies are becoming bleak There is no where to turn Their ships we shall burn Suddenly I feel A piercing makes me shrill An arrow through my heart My inner soul shall part Part Ahmose successes me Make their end complete Dynasty aggressive dynasty They made a dynasty Aggressive dynasty
