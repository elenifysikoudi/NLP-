"Without sin I can't make religion As without sin there's no whoredom And when in my heart god becomes a harlot I shall sin sin sin again "" Every world has its space Every life has its time Every mass has its god Every god has his guillotine "" To possess thy mother I desire not Nay to slay thy father neither 'Tis thy god I yearn to kill Thus reigning universal With my beak I want to peck at his face And from ye golden cups divine blood drink Trespass borders which do not exist I want to be born grow and rise again And become Become you unity Be all and nothing equally Dust of universe and its essence And look attentively Every star is a stone In the cosmic pavement on which step you And your odyssey has no beginning And never look too far you fool 'Cause it has no fuckin end "
