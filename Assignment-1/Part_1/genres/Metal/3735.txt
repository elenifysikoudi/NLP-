Life's circle has come to pass release the soul free at last This is not a tragic end but a new beginning to start again Let us gather ceremony commence a sacred clearing is where we begin The tools for this trade are small and few Ripping and crushing the priest is to do Life's circle has come to pass release the soul free at last As he sharpens up his blade bring the body here she lays Looking up into the sky the birds of prey are quick to fly Down insert the blade deep within Tear cutting flesh from limb to limb Break crush and shatter very bone Pray gut the corpse the blood runs cold Vultures drawing closer still beginning now to feast at will Her memory now just remains all flesh and bones are carried away Life a tribute to the ways of old Death this is a sky burial Fly to the light her spirit flows Up this is a sky burial Save and preserve the top half of the skull From this we drunk in great celebration A toast to long life and to prosperity A toast to this ancient archaic belief Life's circle has come to pass release the soul free at last This is not a tragic end but a new beginning to start again Let us gather ceremony commence a sacred clearing is where we begin The tools for this trade are small and few Ripping and crushing the priest is to do Life a tribute to the ways of old Death this is a sky burial Fly to the light her spirit flows Up this is a sky burial
