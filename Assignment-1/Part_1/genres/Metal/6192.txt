Solitude of this elevation brought into the levels of hell Corpse of these great demons comes earth and sky Lecherous in these accounts of wisdom Bearing weight of masters shall bear curse Endurance in perdition without sufferance Contradiction in swallowed ruin of the defying These reflections observed in fault of past with sin Inscribed in the intersection of these inferior deities Renounce the arcane lore of this disregard Closing these seals in reverence to the storm god Subliminal sorcery to emanate this force of chaos Observe the destruction of the superstitious Contest to the snakes of Algol Abhor the stone filled sight Eclipsing evil spirit of smokeless fire Implosive to the soul collide in vain Fiend of the esoteric to immerse in vortex Vessels of transmutation for the ancient ones Destructive forces within genesis of evil Hurled into polar constrain unified in this immune anguish This frozen atrophied sun has its namesake on this oblivion Diabolic in eternity Abominate this prophecy Dishonor the snakes with eyes of a marble gaze Kept alive in the embrace of fear beneath this silence Elements in this reform of malevolent indifference Conspiracy of eternal compassion crushed by misguided souls Delusion in form lies the vile truth in secrecy of hell Perversions of mercy to bare mark of the necrophile Anthem in this desecration for the infection in grace Pandemonium will reach neglect of the forgiveness of man's soul Intercession these cursed hands will have no cause for god Hallowed effigy everlasting in truth of the slayer of Christ's whore
