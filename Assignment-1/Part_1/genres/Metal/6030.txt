We found our stepping stone Over darkest hours We left no trace at home But saw our footprints ahead It was our dream stone Stardust would shine our way There was a beautiful vision that night All shades were bright With hope to catch the sight Of northern lights And touch a cooling star We watched the moonstones Swim in brightest colors Reached for horizons To touch the line that separates earth from sky Stardust would shine our way With hope to catch that sight of the northern lights With hope to catch the sight Of the northern lights And touch a cooling star
