Take me hold me In your palms I feel so calm Clean me erase me Heal my wounds and remove my filth Empty soulless My heart of stone so ashen cold Tearing burning The years of pain I can't forget Forever scarred Come share my pain Stare into my eyes Never close the door on me Run share my hate Feel my wrath inside Never come to close to me Wake me shake me From this nightmare my own hell Touch me clutch me Tear my mask my veil of lies Feel me be me I'm the blood inside your veins Show me guide me Help me find my way back home
