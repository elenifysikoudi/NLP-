Look into my eyes tell me your alive Look into my eyes can you hear me now Can you hear us now Speaking the words That would never cross your mind Can you hear us now Hope you fail once you bury the bodies And you can't live without it I'm in your head I won't forget Your love is dead and you got nothing left Your love is dead and we've all been broken Sorry to say we're so better off Sorry to say your wrong Can you hear us now Speaking the words That would never cross your mind Can you see us now Hope you fail once you bury the bodies And you can't live without it Yet you can't breathe without it And you cant live without it Don't talk so much Your a liar you don't need to breathe You said you said you said we're done We see right through you Can you hear us now Speaking the words That would never cross your mind Can you see us now Hope you fail once you bury the body And you can't live without it And you can't breathe without it And you can't live without it
