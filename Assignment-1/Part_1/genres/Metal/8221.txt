"Will I ever be free With my heart and soul I walk these colossal times with you and the hallucination Caressing the flames of your eyes The deepest of my sorrows And once more time I'm alone A Crashing tide of grief washed over me Blinded by bitter tears of rejection And the sound of grey aspirations In this Inner Temple I'll die in my cosmos within I'll fly Towards the pyramid of feelings I'll walk so far away I thought that you were the one my sad heart kissed my tears As the moon and stars are gathering ""I must kill the present And respect the unseen future"" I walk these colossal times caressing the flames of your eyes The statues of my voluntary fall Will stand until the sand covers me The sand will cover me and once more time I'm alone "
