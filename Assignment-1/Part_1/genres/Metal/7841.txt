In these valleys roams my deceased soul Like the wolf of night it howls In memoriam of my sinned past My lust for desecration grows Cleansing of an ancient race Where beauty is in its bestial form The darkest coffin shall be my throne Before my lies visions of pain A dawning age of fear for shapes that are weak I taste their blood for it's now pure I'll drown my skin in my enemies life I await for the holocaust My mind transforms once flesh now flame I show no fear for the holocaust
