Stigmata Stigmata Stigmata Stigmata Save Me It's happening again I started to bleed From my hands and feet In an odour so sweet Painful holy wounds of four The blood loss increase Terrified I see they open wide Oh don't give me number Five The pain become extreme The more I will bleed Whipped by a force unseen And pushed down on my knees Something holds me down I can't get away If this is a gift from god I give my soul to hell Lord why have you abandoned me Why don't you hear my cries Why do I have to feel this pain Please don't you just let me die Stigmata Stigmata The pain become extreme The more I will bleed Whipped by a force unseen And pushed down on my knees Something holds me down I can't get away If this is a gift from god I give my soul to hell Lord why have you abandoned me Why don't you hear my cries Why do I have to feel this pain Please don't you just let me die Stigmata Stigmata Stigmata Stigmata Stigmata Stigmata Stigmata Stigmata
