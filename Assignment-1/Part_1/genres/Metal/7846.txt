My shadowed spirit has become a hollow void There is no solace nothing left but pain Forever I am called to cross into the unknown Yet there is a fear which I don't understand I must retreat from this grasp of life Embracing the dark rejoicing in this pain Forever I'll roam in the realm of my God I shall escape all that I hate I am beyond their emotions I am at one with the dead Revile and despise the traditions of mankind Crush the barriers that enslave your soul And pass the gate to the netherworld Enter the realm where evil prevails I drift off into foreign worlds from the fear of mortal life Pains of steel sweep my arm I seek the land where humanity dies The blade does caress my neck and the life flows from the wound No longer to be mortal I'll now exist as a God
