Two crayons sat upon a bed One was green the other red The sheets were blue to set the mood The silly crayons name was Fred He told her that he was in love Outside the window singing doves Sewed and pressed on bright blue sky And crawling were two lady bugs He nudged her with a giggle She smiled and scootched in a little If she had a hand he would grasp He gave her a purple skittle He poked his girl and lent a hug As they rolled around ontop a rug Two little crayons fell in love Two little crayons fell in love It was the same for you and me Curled and hunched under a tree The shade blocked the sun so hot My hands were in your pocket I licked my lips I could taste it now The love for you left me in awe Two little kids fell in love Two little kids fell in love Oh I fell in love with you It wasn't something I was supposed to do But I fell in love with you The wrappers wrapped them up so tight And held them all throughout the night Colors mixed to form a new Crayons remind me of you He poked his girl and lent a hug As they rolled around ontop a rug Two little crayons fell in love Two little crayons fell in love Oh I fell in love with you It wasn't something I was supposed to do But I fell in love with you And now they fall asleep together Each one holding each other Two little crayons fell in love Two little crayons fell in love
