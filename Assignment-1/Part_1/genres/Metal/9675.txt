Souls are crushed With a brittle sound Like crumbs are crushed When a table's undone Their blood was their wine Their mind was their meat Here they sat But now they're gone So bring a law that crime won't break So bring a lamb that wolves can't take So bring a light the blind can see Goats bleat God speed bring up the fee Souls fall Over the edge Like scraps from a table For whom was it set For whom was it sent Propelling scythes Propelling scythes Into propelling scythes they went SERVE IT AS A WARNING SERVE IT AS A WARNING SERVE IT AS A WARNING SERVE IT AS A WARNING GOATS BLEAT FOR THE MOURNING GOATS BLEAT FOR THE MOURNING GOATS BLEAT FOR THE MOURNING GOATS BLEAT FOR THE MOURNING
