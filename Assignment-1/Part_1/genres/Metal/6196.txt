Devourment of ghost Sacrifice in homage to reject this mercy Cruelty to consume the vitality beneath the flesh Legacy of the funeral Allow this body of the soulless to be raised as great gate Channeling the chambers of blood to bring his rebirth Shaping this myth within a lunatic's mind No forgiveness attained Alive within this altar of flesh Forever to be this restraint in promised pain Veins are emptied and embalmed with the appetite of betrayal Speechless lips are removed to invoke the words of the dead Infestation of belief that promised broken lies These ties with the unholy came true before these eyes Take these hands of betrayal and succumb to the defiance of death Lying in the arms of the sick kissing this seduction of spilling blood The reality in promised faith now lies imprisoned in dark shrines Breathing out these streams of blood this horror grows inside These fears await the butcher's knife On wings of steel a soul will rise Methods of enslaving of the absolute For the degrading of eternity Blessed in the grasp of desecrated rites This fearless journey to resurrect Upon countless years we've died Etched scars in the skin of the attained The lifeless reborn once again Addiction in this infernal flame Surface this unclean soul as mouths of the underworld speak through wounds The regeneration of silenced pureness is strangled by intestines In halls of the confined this silence dies By avenging screams seeds of life cease Amnesty in the corrupt This black consumes the mind The paleness of the eyes This sight is content in submergence Emerged from stripped flesh Arise from the shell of god Flood waters of the baptized engulfing life to give birth to the cold of hell Self indulgence in the creation of perverse fear Hands now made tools of surgery Sinister ways of salvation Dissection of this savior Released from the calling of sighs Succumb to this arrogance in these words that dominate Blood runs beneath these eyes Entrance to the skull we find sickness of life Now march to the sounds of funeral cries
