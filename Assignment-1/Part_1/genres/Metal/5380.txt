The light is shining Still I'm not so surprised One thousand voice mails For one thousand lies Blind faith lost trust All along it was plain to see Years passed lost touch Leads the path to insanity Take another shot show me what you got It was never gonna last forever Open your eyes try and realize Once is enough so tonight now I say No more from a voice that breaks the awkward silence No more never heard so loud before Made the same mistakes a thousand times Never meant to be like this so I say No more tonight And it feels all right Dark nights long passed Waking up from a pointless dream Brighter days brighter times Hides the fatal reality Questions answers False addiction to nothing real Lights fade crushed to dust Desperation in tragedy Take another shot show me what you got It was never gonna last forever Open your eyes try and realize Once is enough so tonight now I say No more from a voice that breaks the awkward silence No more never heard so loud before Made the same mistakes a thousand times Never meant to be like this so I say No more tonight And it feels all right No more Same old game we play together No more Time will pass we'll still remember No more But tonight this game is over No more Strangers in the night forever No more from a voice that breaks the awkward silence No more never heard so loud before Made the same mistakes a thousand times Never meant to be like this so I say No more tonight And it feels all right And it feels all right
