I look far away the candles of my burning desire The sun seems so dismal our mighty sky is in dismay Make my words be like pictures for the dreams I have fall My hate is shining bright to create the mourningstar So rise Can the moon read my mind so hopeless here I stand There's hate in my veins the stair is unseen There's bitterness in my pain my harmony is rotting Save me your essence embrace me fly with me The tower we've build the life that is ours The tower we've build the life that is ours I look far away the candles of my burning desire The sun seems so dismal our mighty is in dismay Let's drown in solitude and reborn in tragedies For the dreams we have done we are the mourningstar
