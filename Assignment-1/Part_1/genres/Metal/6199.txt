We are coming to smash their idols We are coming to wreck their laws Break these binds free our lives We are coming to deaden their hope We are coming to destroy their lie Seize the moment ready for the fight When the heavens are nothing will you beg for remorse When the heavens are burning will you tremble with fright We are coming to taste their blood We are coming defile their gods Destroying this disease of faith We are coming to rape their minds We are coming to steal their souls This revolt starting to unfold When the heavens turn black will you pray for the end When the heavens seep blood will you cringe at our wrath This will is long dead This faith is long forgotten Slaying the pig of faith abominations praised Marked for death this blade tastes blood Cleave this plague of heaven from our hearts We are of the moon our dark side unknown As the grassy fields burn Fire gleams within my eyes Dark is the way of this coming age We are coming to crush their rapture We are coming to break their faith Final act of this disaster When the heavens have failed will you plead for your life When the heavens come falling be prepared to die
