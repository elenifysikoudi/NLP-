Now that we're through The hell with you We don't mind We just give it a sigh We hardly knew What you were capable Of doing But why don't you give it a try Oh you learn about it Oh you harvest until you can make no more All that's eating inside All that's eating inside We hardly knew What you were capable Of doing But why don't you give it a try Oh you learn about it Oh you harvest untill you can make no more All that's eating inside All that's eating inside Can't take no more Oh you learn about it Oh you harvest untill you can make no more All that's eating inside All that's eating inside Can't take no more
