Among the crowds I stand Taunting and cheering The Shaman points his hand I am the one the Gods want The Gods have been angered Tormenting the land Ripping through the crops Feel the wrath of the Gods hand Slaves to the Gods Slaves to the table Sacrificer Sacrificer The blood table glows Complete with a set of knives Your sins the shaman knows I shout for my life Thrown on the table Hit with the obsidian knife Thrown down the temple stairs The sacrifice begins Slaves to the Gods Slaves to the table Sacrificer Sacrificer
