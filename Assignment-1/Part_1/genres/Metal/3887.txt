i guess they had it when they said i was a simple man but even simple men can try a complicated plan blue sky above me crazy this was lovely blue sky above me green grass around me body on the ground see blue sky above me i cant watch you play bourgeois ive had too much to drink i cant keep you happy all sweet maidens are extinct and i cant say im damaged thats just lazy monochrome but i caaaaaaaaan i can flee in longing to a frigid libertine and i can give another every bit thats left of me i can still remember every painting every poem but i caaaaaaaaan this was happiness ill take all these things that are on your desk tell me ohhhh signs of loving care break into your house shadowy despair tell me ohhhh the table and the bed all the places that ownership was bred tell me woaahhh but the tragedy is that you and me are just like anyone else blue sky above me crazy this was lovely crazy you were lovely i guess ive learned that i am capable of giant lies and it is in that spirit that i do apologize
