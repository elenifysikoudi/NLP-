We crown him with the crown of thorns This is the end of a life that's been poured out for all mankind In suffering manifest glory has come at the fullness of time King of kings beaten and broken down Why would He live like a servant King of kings descending lower now Why should He die like a slave The proud will be humbled the meek will inherit the earth The last will be first do inherit the earth I know down is the way up so master show me how to serve The last will be first do inherit the earth It should have been me With the nails through my hand and feet Facing the wrath of God It should have been me Left to pay for my sin forsaken But in the blood I stand here Born to die He bore the fire of God's holy wrath on his shoulders Born to die I watched him pour out his life as a ransom for all And as he carried his cross on his back beaten and bloody I saw myself there too because I've been broken by a world that hates me But I'm not alone anymore No one could take his life he laid it down for me That twisted wreath of thorns he took that crown for me then after three days out of the ground for me he overcame it all Now I live to serve him With stripes on his back betrayed by the ones that he'd loved so perfectly we spit in his face and we crowned him We crown him with the crown of thorns
