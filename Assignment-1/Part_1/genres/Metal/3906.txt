Into the fray we can't jump to conclusions For we are not what it seems like Give me your hand give me your hand I came to you you promised me that you were on just a temporary phase sheets in the wind no harm at all No blood no foul But now you're hurt And it's just killing me to see Tonight I'd do anything to untie you from this locomotive If falling faster helps I'll sink into oblivion I'll sink so fast your head will spin You hold the vapor in your hands To disregard the scent that pulls you out This fleeting glimpse is all you have Please don't blink twice It will disappear before your eyes I saw the look in your eyes Screaming out for mercy Sidestepping series of disappearing waves Of disappointment All the things that hold you back Please tell me why you won't let me in You're slitting your own neck And I can't stop you from trying If falling faster helps I'll sink into oblivion I'll sink so fast your head will spin You hold the vapor in your hands To disregard the scent that pulls you out This fleeting glimpse is all you have Please don't blink twice It will disappear before your eyes Your heart is beating faster now With abrasive syllables you stumble for a shaky word My heart is bursting for the time When sleep won't come Till safety rings in my ears I'll never be able to sleep I'll never be able to sleep again Thanks for coming He said as he walked up to the steps With our heads held low Aware of out cracked faces in the sun We had been running for so long We had been running That our shoes were as paper as we struggled on these blistered feet His words are as a gentle breeze We had been sweating grief stricken tears we had been crying But it was finished all along Now we can hold our hears up high And say that it was worth the climb The struggle for our very soul The struggle was not ours at all
