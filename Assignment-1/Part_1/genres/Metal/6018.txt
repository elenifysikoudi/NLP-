I feel like I am hurt Can't you see I try to express But I act like you're a stranger to me I want to share but don't know how My eyes can't speak And my mouth won't write it down And there's so much confusion as I want to clear it up Cause when I start suddenly the end has begun Maybe if I touch you will feel what I mean but you're acting strange Cause my eyes look differently Caught by death I do not hope that my release is decided long ago I try to get out To jump at once in a place Where it's all right or wrong and I won't be afraid I open myself for you and all those others
