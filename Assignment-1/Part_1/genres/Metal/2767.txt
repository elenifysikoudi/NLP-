Cut him Somebody take flight from this stage to the crowd below And expose a bloody nose from the the flows of your elbows No crowd control This is no holds barred we gonna brawl Until you knocked out sprawled In your socks and draws with the paramedics involved Engage the mosh pit and lose control until the stage fold Because bionic ain't leaving until you suffocatin in the front row I wanna see shoulder blades ricochet off the ribcage This is new age stress age for boogie down renegades in rage You wanna body bang this is insane War games with nothing to gain but pain If you ready for war then hit the the floor everybody come on You're in the swarm you're in the swarm You wanna bang let's go bring the pain let's go You hit em high high I hit em low low If you ready for war then hit the the floor everybody come on You're in the swarm you're in the swarm You wanna bang let's go bring the pain let's go You hit em high high I hit em low low This section is reserved for those hard to kill So shove him in his chest hard enough to turn his lungs to gills Dislocate your shoulder is the quota These blows send your head to nova scotia When animalistic impulse take over Mosh monster behold the head trauma get down No do si doe this is the true essence of the underground From sunshine or rain we toss on asphalt terrain Till we levitate over the crowd with your eye balls gouged You wanna body bang this is insane War games with nothing to gain but pain If you ready for war then hit the the floor everybody come on You're in the swarm you're in the swarm You wanna bang let's go bring the pain let's go You hit em high high I hit em low low If you ready for war then hit the the floor everybody come on You're in the swarm you're in the swarm You wanna bang let's go bring the pain let's go You hit em high high I hit em low low I'm goin insane I feel the temperature rise but can I maintain All the pushin and shovin it's like we gang bang It's a thin line between livin and dyin' I'm goin insane I feel the temperature rise but can I maintain All the pushin and shovin it's like we gang bang It's a thin line between livin and dyin' You wanna body bang this is insane War games with nothing to gain but pain You wanna clash with it We can clash with it And see who be the last man to stand with it If you ready for war then hit the the floor everybody come on You're in the swarm you're in the swarm You wanna bang let's go bring the pain let's go You hit em high high I hit em low low If you ready for war then hit the the floor everybody come on You're in the swarm you're in the swarm You wanna bang let's go bring the pain let's go You hit em high high I hit em low low
