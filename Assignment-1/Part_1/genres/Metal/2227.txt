all humans must go one's faster one's slow but one thing all know the dead is coming to us sometimes natural die the most later they live on as ghosts being part of this glory with your personal story I will leave this world lying down on earth the dead has taken my soul sorry there is no control I have reached this special point where I creep and have no breath I'm alone in this world lying down down on earth I will leave this world lying down on earth the dead has taken my soul sorry there is no control no control from this point I'm dreaming no more I'm breathing no more from this point I'm creeping no more I'm dying no more I will leave this world lying down on earth the dead has taken my soul sorry there is no control no control
