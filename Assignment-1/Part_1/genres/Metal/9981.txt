Into the night the darkest corner of my mind Sink into my inner self an erotic fantasy A spiraling vortex an instant alter ego fix Here I am the ruler of all in this kingdom of sin Sinister Mephisto Ride the sky Sinister Mephisto The ultimate high What I can't have in actuality I feast upon in my reality An extravaganza of forbidden pleasures No sexual wish dark enough to suppress I am no longer a mortal man As master of the ceremony divine perversion I hereby declare the orgy to begin Ravage your luscious virgin flesh how I love it My cup runneth over drink my distilled insanity Sinister Mephisto Ride the sky Sinister Mephisto The ultimate high Uhrrah Sinister Mephisto Ride the sky Sinister Mephisto The ultimate high So high
