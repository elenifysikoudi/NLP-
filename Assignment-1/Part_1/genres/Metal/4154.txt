The centuries of woe have passed away With eternal youth at my command I unleash hell Cast out ov Egypt were we with lust embraced serpentine heart Our wrath shalt now shower o'er the earth Praise to thee whose tongue doth speak fire Dionisos Orpheus Attis Osiris Slain now resurrected shackled now released Bring forth ecstasy the ulmost delight Come wholly to me as lifes water is poured by thy side 'Twas from sacred society not mother we were spawned To manifest by Will alone our visions more it be We are the khaos warriors The architects ov fate Our sight sees far beyond The light of the day Our thoughts secluded well Amidst the darkness of night Shall be no final warning Before our battle cry Breathe out in ecstasy swallow the seed of truth Transgression is the might transgression is the key This is the law of scourge the EYE ov true revenge Placing trust upon our blade against ignorance Dionisos Orpheus Attis Osiris Slain now resurrected shackled now released Hear is crippled souls behold is ye blind fools Awake in fear and feel the touch ov bitter bliss Its no time for repenting its time to kiss our swords We are the new beginning we light our torch ov war We are the kaos warriors Modern iconoclast Cleansers lurking waiting To conquer the universe We are all and without equal Our fists crush the concrete walls Our hearts infused with rage In freedom our souls burn Conquered we can be not Our fate tis fueled by forces Awakening to herald The dawn of New Aeon rites
