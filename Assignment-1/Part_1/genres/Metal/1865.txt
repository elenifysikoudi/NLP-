Closer one step closer One step closer to me Show yourself your real face It's time to clear who'd you be I wanna know what can you say Reasons are what I wanna hear Speak about you about your life That relegated me Away go to hell away Don't wanna control me You try to make me blind But you lie to me I see I got truth on my side And I do what I like That's all I can say Go to hell away Don't wanna judge me Don't judge me Don't wanna bind me I can't live that way Closer one step closer Try to tell some more You can't than give up my friend That's the only solution I know
