No sense at all do what you want for I will hunt you Untill you will be Locked away just so what you'll be scred of me Behind my power I will hide all my fears Right now you are punished for absolutely nothing And I feel so good Because once more I don't have to be honest With myself While you're locked away Just so you'll be scared of me behind my power I will hide al my fears It is fierce and it moves slow
