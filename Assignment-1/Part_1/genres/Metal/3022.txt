My ever waking contempt for our sick way of life steals from me any Last hope for us as a species To survive ourselves I watch us breed I watch us drown in our oily Seas of greed forever lost A time before the machine manufactured ideals pushed onus all day a Few shall dictate as we fall Disillusioned I tear away all the bullshit fed to me every day Choking As I'm smothered in the media Swarms of pressured thoughts distorted truths are your words for me Manufactured ideals pushed On us all a few shall decide as we all fall disillusioned I tear away All the bullshit fed to me Everyday our world stands on its last withering legs and I struggle to Find a reason to care For your pained screams are echoed in the laughter of those who seal Our fate they seal our fate My ever waking contempt for our sick way of life steals from me any Last hope for Survival of us As a species lost I watch us dig our grave our own fucking grave
