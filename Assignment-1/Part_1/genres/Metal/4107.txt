Space space Spaceboy Spaceboy you're sleepy now Your silhouette is so stationary Spaceboy you're sleepy now Your silhouette is so stationary You're released but your custody calls And I want to be free Don't you want to be free Do you like girls or boys It's confusing these days But moon dust will cover you cover you This chaos is killing me space fucking boy Spaceboy fuck you space fucking boy Bye bye love Bye bye fucking Spaceboy Bye bye love Fuck up Spaceboy Bye bye my love
