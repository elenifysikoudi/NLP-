El odio no me acosa El dinero no me atrae Si piedro todo no me importa Solo tengo un camino la libertad It seems like I got no voice can you hear me Listen to me It seems like I can't be heard are you with me Listen to me Never step back never look back It's your decision Look at your life are you still alive It's revolution Never give up never give in I'm never gonna give it up again I see in your eyes you all wanna rise You ought to better Forget the lies throw off all disguise Do you remember You are the boys who started the noise I wanna hear you Never resign don't say you don't mind It's all up to you Can't stop all we want is our tomorrow This time the only thing you gotta do is to follow And our dream will be real I hate what I see but I gotta see The fake smile of a king for a day I'm sorry to say but I don't wanna play this game A fight for the fame it's gone too far We're the sound from the underground That's who we are
