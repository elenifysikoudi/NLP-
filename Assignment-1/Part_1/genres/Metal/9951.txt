Across the lake of fire through the desserts of decay The flames are burning higher In this land of death you're easy prey Black earth Save our souls Black earth Save our souls Looking back in anger at the twentieth century Tormented we surrender in artificial serenity Twisted torn and burnt violation of the crust Man got what man deserved Turned the future into dust Black earth Save our souls Black earth Save our souls A millenarian failure the dark age has returned Waiting for a miracle to save the common herd In a century of darkness the horror spreads within As our planet stops to turn all hope is lost for man Black earth Save our souls Black earth Save our souls
