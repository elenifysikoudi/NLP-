look at me I am the crippled now could you ever hold me again Did you ever look and see what I was Ever was I known when I was true And if this is all I am Then peace becomes my rotten soul They split themselves apart And chase away those adored they leave behind the binding hope they chose to fight in fear of this I hear a million cries pleas only to be heard I see a million smiles pasted on faces of pain they are scaling worlds oblivious to their own all for fear of being hurt all for fear of being known all on their own never asking on they fall martyrs for lies
