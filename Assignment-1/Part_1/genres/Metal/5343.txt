We come from Over the dark horizon sky With twisted tales of sacrifice To imagine or believe all the glory of the free Hunting all day an endless cry The things I've seen I can't deny Sinners saints all mixed in one The dawn of time has begun Why can't you see what they're doing to me Is it fair that I'm dying in vain Once in a land of sacrifice now only valleys of demise Shadows of a pale blue moonlight ride the waves of entity Why can't you see what they're doing to thee Is it fair that you all die in vain Ride with the steel and the power of the sword Stand up and fight now and forever more Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire To be free there must be black fire Through the day and through the night with dragons heart the warrior strikes This is the day that they'll be known as my enemy Why can't you see what they're doing To what we believe in we rise through the pain Ride with the steel and the power of the sword Stand up and fight now and forever more Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire To be free there must be black fire We come from distant lands we travel so far Can you see the bleeding scar The prizes of life we fail to win 'Cause we doubt the power within Why can't you see what they're doing to What we believe in we rise through the pain Ride with the steel and the power of the sword Stand up and fight now and forever more Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire To be free there must be black fire Black fire
