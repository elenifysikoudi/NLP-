How hard to fall asleep when I miss your majesty How hard to live when I long for your devil's warmth And livid skies over Wittenberg And the empty streets and pavements of the town Everything sinks into dead tears And craves for charlatantry Mephisto you are born inside me again But will you speak my names in the ancient tongues Among thousands flames of profigacy Naked bodies flowing in the stream of wild dreams I strip myself of my sacred virtues The picture of male domination and treat in blood And blood and pride old and clotted already But I can still see its drops on my bot face And pain and candles everywhere and incense And your dream which I wish to wake up in every day Everything so ephemental and equally unreal And this blood and candles burnt away and they burn till today Mephistopheles thousands times I saw in sleep The essence of the eternal life but have I found it If I am who I am then I shall bombard the human race with the spell of hell I shall go deeper down the Dante did And tame the snakes of mine Phallic signs and symbols the seed of truth And belief in eternal life
