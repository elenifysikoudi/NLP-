Can't do that please forget The things I need there's more than only to breath Twisted and dreams crying and defeat Love and fear Buried beneath those facts Which controle it's all there Sent me grief sent me joy To become myself trying to gather the truth Eternal faith blame myself Pleasing the one from inside Cause there is where it's at take my breath Wet my eyes turn me inside out and never lie And if you cry I'll take the side That needs in the first place Be my guest I will not push I will not try to take more than you want Cause what would you have done if the truth was done wrong And please forget we can't have those thing And please forget we'll act like we've just met And please forget we can do it all over again Please forget we'll act like we've just met I don't wanna do it right Wonder about her last flight
