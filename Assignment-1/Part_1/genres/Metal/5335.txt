On wings of burning fire across the oceans far The legends of the seven seas and mystic fallen star Their laden ships are sailing on towards the sun To the island of the everlasting chosen one Face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail The crown and the shining light Punishment and anger in the fire of your soul Prepare the eternal fight Lost in a dream in a boundless sea Rivers of pain are guiding me Defending this land from the sins of man Never surrender our dreams again Ride forever onwards stare into the sun Where hopes and dreams are everlasting marching on and on Rise another day across the distant skies Where the dawn above the winter moonlight shines upon the fall of our lives Insanity sublime shall make my bleeding heart Feel cold and fearless anger rising far beyond the dark In search of might and wisdom sacrifice our souls In the name of truth and justice never to be told Face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail The crown and the shining light Punishment and anger in the fire of your soul Prepare the eternal fight Can you not feel the eternal pain Flows through your heart and every vein The torture begins and it breaks you down Nothing to save when the soul is gone Ride forever onwards stare into the sun
