I believe in Satan Who rend both heavens and earth And in the Antichrist His dearly misbegotten The anguish ov our future A Bastard spawned from lie Born ov a harlot nun Reign high in luxury Aloft the kings ov man I use words sharp as a sword To rake Saints shins bestrewn Three days risen the grand deceiver I bless the world with ire and woe So can you hoard host like Zion's coin Belie progeny ov your pain IHWH thou sayeth unto me Thou disrupter imbalance my creations Hence I transfix in bliss ov flagellation I burnt in rapture wafted ash about Became the law above all laws In asymmetry ov the horns I cut loose the cord ov li f e Depart celestial source Rub mould in holy pages Let woodworms eat the cross I prayed I'd die in you O Lord I pray you'd die in me
