Standing in the Heads of the graves As I count the Universal Dreamscapes I watch the Silent Journey of Souls with Joy an Pity for their Eternal quest A thousand years of Misery ago I was Created From Moon Dust My Mother was the blood of my enemies and the Fire of the sun my Father An invisible chain forged in thorns embrace and unite my crimson memory to the crypts of Insanity and delirium where I can't find the Reality Dark Motions Black eyes and and mournful Lust The wings of solitude I'm cursed to follow the Dead to see how they vanish to their Destiny To feel and envy their final trip coz I'm not allowed to see the final gate
