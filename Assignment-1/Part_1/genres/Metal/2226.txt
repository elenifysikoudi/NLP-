Make you understand Than I fight'til the end No effect on me If you try spread misery I'm a believer I'm a believer A spring board to my brain For you it's only a game Just another try for me To progress for my victory Believer I'm a believer I'm a believer How long you'll stay with me I'm your worst enemy I'm a believer for you no compromise No compromise Believer believer believer So now I'm free And you'll see Don't go back to past Assassinate the scars
