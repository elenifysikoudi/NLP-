Touch this tender beautiful face Feel her warmth within within me What was the real reason To say good bye and leave my life I'll it try To walk alone I'll it try And all is gone Don't follow the blind Don't follow the blind A stranger in presence Walked blind through This world Did not behold what broke To many fragments Walking all alone I'll it try To walk alone I'll it try To stay alone Don't follow the blind Don't follow the blind And you'll see And you'll see
