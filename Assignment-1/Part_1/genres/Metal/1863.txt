Now I can see they're not any better Their lies give em some more chances Lil more time but can't play with fate It's too late to hide from my hate I know what will be my weapon I use yours that goddamn silence Now I arm myself and I turn Against you in your perfect world I empower from down under Tear the ancient instincts open They are leading me through my life I feed myself through my roots My pain was only a lesson Learned who I really can count on This taught me how to live my life Overcome myself to survive
