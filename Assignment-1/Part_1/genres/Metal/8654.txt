today I've tried to live one more foolish dream don't you see my soul's inner seas can you feel the blame that now is unveiled as pain sweetly embraces my earthly hell It's always sad when our words don't express our true believes failing what our eyes have to say don't you see my soul's inner seas can you feel the blame that now is unveiled as pain slowly embraces my earthly hell
