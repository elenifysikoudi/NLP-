Dusk Embrace me Enter the kingdom of light Night Surround me Cover the sky with your might Thunder Caress me Slap my face with delight Storm Revocate me As I scream in your eye As I scream in your eye Revocate me Come Join me Enter the remains of night Lust and Pain Taste the devils vine Thunder Caress me Slap my face with delight Storm Revocate me As I scream in your eye When you call upon me With a voice of sorrow and tears I'll be there to guide you Through the dusk of nightfall
