My wounds are widely opened now Time has come to plunge into despair Darkness is the only wish of this world of sorrow There is no place for joy in my bleeding heart I cannot reach my innner peace That I deserve in my griefful moments Someday I will drown myself into my neverending tears Someday I will see myself dying of eternal sufferings My blood is frozen into my veins All I can feel is this loneliness Which has been invading me for countless years Which is leading me to these eternal sufferings
