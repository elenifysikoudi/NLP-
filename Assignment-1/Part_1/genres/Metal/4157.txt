Where the magic stream flows Through the singing woods Blue grass of wisdom grows Around the oaken roots Where the golden dragons fly And the sorcerers gather Four wooden statues stand And the fog lays thick Dreamthrone of amber Cosmic source of might Reflection of wisdom Power of the darkside Ceremonial steel drinks blood Paintig pearls and gold Mystic flames burn bright Around the oaken lord Forgotten sorcery storms from the skies From the golden hall of the ancient ones Forgotten sorcery storms from the skies From the golden hall of the ancient ones The pagan awaits the equinox Cosmic sorcery the gift of the skies Magic of nature stronger then your lies Stone demigod shines proud The cult of the barbaric seasons Pagan pride forever Born to die with honour not to serve on knees Snowcovered wild wastelands My beloved fatherland I see the tears of the oaken one My heart is like a stone My sword became sharp Crosses to break Bodies to dismember Flowers to burn
