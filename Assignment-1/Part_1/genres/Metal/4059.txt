" We are no evil don't fear We have the truth you must hear We've created your world Like in tales you have heard When everything was still fine In the course of our time We created the sword And four stones gave the force That force was the key To bring life everywhere we could see We are those real spirits you know And those voices in altar were wrong We helped you survive years ago We gave you the power so strong Your land is the youngest from our creation The best of this whole generation It's the shelter to all those four powers The haven from the darkest souls Then something went wrong We made land very strong All they wanted was death Till the end of last breath When someone's using the force Darkness will find it's source Evil knows where you are Where they come it's not far That force was the key Bring life everywhere we could see We are those real spirits you know And those voices in altar were wrong We helped you ""to"" survive years ago We gave you the power so strong "
