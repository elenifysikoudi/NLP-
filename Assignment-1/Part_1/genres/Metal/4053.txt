I research Maegons notes and I find an old black book The book tells the truth about creation of this world In the beginning Great Spirits of the Cryon Had created a sword which will unite all four powers I take my sword into my hand I see there are marks of this land The earth and the wind the fire and the ice I could have all those powers and then I could rise My sword is the key to that force Now it's time to open the final door I'll find my way in there where the Gods keep their meetings I'll unite all the powers into one Then I'll rise to lead the land of the Cryon With my Sword of Salvation I send a message to the Gods that there has been a fight And the Great Warriors have found the darkest light Now the Gods have to gather in Dale Soon they all can have their final pray I'll find my way in there where the Gods keep their meetings I'll unite all the powers into one Then I'll rise to lead the land of the Cryon With my Sword of Salvation With my Sword of Salvation As Maegon I go to Dale Then they all can have their final pray I'll find my way in there where the Gods keep their meetings I'll unite all the powers into one Then I'll rise to lead the land of the Cryon With my Sword of Salvation I'll find my way in there where the Gods keep their meetings I'll unite all the powers into one Then I'll rise to lead the land of the Cryon With my Sword of Salvation With my Sword of Salvation
