Just like a black crow What tears your flesh with fire Bites you a torturing desire The instict what's preying your mind From inside destroy you But don't ask me why 'cos you're bleeding from 1000 wounds And you're in cage of force What keeps you back and you burn While you'll be just a corp You fear you past But you don't really understand Just look at your blood in the sand
