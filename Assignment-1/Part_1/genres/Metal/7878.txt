On my command we started it all When heaven burned We torched their holy kingdom Our eyes on the angels turned They screamed out in pain When they were swallowed by flames It's the end of them and their holy era Soon all of heaven will be in flames Heaven's doomsday roars when their kingdom falls An eternity in pain It's the end of them and their holy era Soon all of heaven will be in flames Angelus exuro pro eternus It's the end of them and their holy era Soon all of heaven will be in flames Heaven's doomsday roars when their kingdom falls An eternity in pain It's the end of them and their holy era Soon all of heaven will be in flames Angelus exuro pro eternus In full force we came blast through the gates Into their holy domain Burnt to the ground Nothing else you'll find Ruins are all that remains It's the end of them and their holy era Soon all of heaven will be in flames Heaven's doomsday roars when their kingdom falls An eternity in pain It's the end of them and their holy era Soon all of heaven will be in flames In flames Angelus exuro pro eternus Angelus exuro pro eternus
