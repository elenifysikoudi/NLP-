My word will set this world aflame Hail me War war war The earth trembles beneath the all conquering Cloven hooves of the black horde for a thousand years The horde has been denied the throne And the wings were taken from our lord He was cast down into the netherworld forever But now it's time for us to reclaim his realm And bring this world into eternal darkness Lucifor lord of the east gather your bewinged legions of The wind and prepare to defend our lord above the ground Satan lord of the south spread your infernal flames across The land and gather your strength to fight for the throne Oh tyrannous master bring hellish storm upon the celestial Kingdom set the vault of heave into flames War Set the legions free open wide your gates let them strike the Earth with your wrathful hate let me see your majestic kingdom Rise before my eyes the abode of the damned Let the weak be hurled into your eternal fire To perish forever more Listen to me infernal legions oh mighty hordes of nightflying Demons throughout the darkness thou shallt ride join my warlords And fight the war with pride Leviathan lord of the west command your apocalyptic wave to Break through the barrier of the weak Belial lord of the north make the earth strong for our legions and Do not deny them to tread forbidden land
