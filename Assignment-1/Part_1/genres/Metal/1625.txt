J Hall D Tretola The key to the door of fate Is held by your ways of hate It will hold better ways to live When you choose to let it give If the door slams in your face Your mind slows down its pace All the anger all these things Make it stop all it brings Take my hand and follow me Look and I'll show you what I see Make a wall and stand in my way It will come out this is what I say If I had the same door as you Would I lock it as you do Do what you do Say what you say Would you live or die where you lay When the reflection of anger Shines back in your eyes You'll see what happened Blindly say your good byes 2x chorus
