I hate that scary face in the mirror Mutilated by your daily terror It keeps an eye all the time on me It's against the one I want to be Have I ever done something to deserve this pain inside How could I leave this damn feeling behind I can't live in uncertainty My place I need to find Will I ever get some rest and peace in my life What do I live for I always want more What would I die for Someday you will know Now prepare yourself to a journey in me Take a deep breathe and sink into this sea What causes this silence Oh damn it is so real I have many things to share But life's too short to feel
