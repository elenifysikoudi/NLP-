I am hunting for your soul It dwells within your heart I lacerate your pounding flesh Your spirits shall be mine So rise my spirits rise Revel in this dead man's body Grip his soul sip the blood Life in death A holy carnage Ravenous I will be a god Carnivorous Jesus I need your flesh Ritual slaughter Fill up the chalice With the essence of your life Liquid strengths trapped in your veins I crave your blood You must die Ravenous I will be a god Carnivorous Jesus I need your flesh Ravenous I will be a god Carnivorous Jesus I need your flesh Flesh
