Gods gather in Dale It's time to make the final move Now I must not fail If I fail my destiny's doomed Now I see the circle of stones One more step and it is done God of the earth We got the letter from you So here we are Is there nothing we can do He is a fraud he's not Maegon Run for you lives he's Delinom By the power of the Spirits I will use this sword I'll become great powerful lord I will hold the land of Cryon No one will be saved And I'll rule this world alone I take the final place I use my sword as a key Lightnings and flames I'm cold like a stone in the sea I see Gods die before me I've gained these powers now you will see By the power of Spirits I did use that sword Now I am great powerful lord I will hold land of Cryon No one will be saved and I rule this world alone As I look all around me I see bodies dead bodies of Gods They are drained now I possess their powers Please let me live take my land but let me live You were one of those who sent me to Dramar Now Die But where is Shemin she cannot be alive If she is she won't be for long Now I've seen how the end has come My powers gone it had been done To the town of wind I must now ride They heal my wounds to shadows then I must hide
