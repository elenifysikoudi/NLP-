The bowels of my thoughts icy lake Drain emotions from my bleeding soul Tears that follow burn my skin Dread to see myself I ain't me The sun encircles my shape on the ice In my shadow I see the people below Their frozen faces staring blank All crying without a sound Thousand degrees below Ice age has begun Subzero Emotions running low My heart is so cold Subzero Hatred in words spewing from their mouths Verbal injection of a freezing void Sunrise in three directions As all their faces turn to laugh Thousand degrees below Ice age has begun Subzero Emotions running low My heart is so cold Subzero
