Who is your god Is he not mine Who is your devil are we the same What makes you worse What makes me better Never to trust again How long have I got In this darkened maze They keep me awake They scream at night Screams at night Who is your master In this shallow grave Born to die for a lie I have no soul I have no pride Genocide Where is justice in this hell Where is liberty I paid the price My life blood runs dry Slowly drained from me Screams at night Alone in this shallow grave I die
