I call the names I've Buried in my mind while in the sky the rain is Boiling in anger spirits of the Decadence and sorrow I summon you be the Mediums of my Disaster One Empire has fallen from it's Wicked grace We Lords of Bitterness of retaliation must taste Revenge Take every possible form of Low life and Slay and Torment their weak essence Toal Pandemonium our great Conquering is here I The Past Finder the commander of pain my secret weapon is covered in ecstasy I'm full of past scars that now are finally healing from Centuries ago we have warned you your ignorance shall be your Tomb Burn with me as you cry and scream but I will play the Final march with mind body and soul full of pride still waiting for my liberation our final destiny
