I am here to save her life Because you told me to And I must obey my obey my master Even when danger strikes T 1000 is here He knows where to find us So you must come with me now Come with me if you want to live Come with me if you want to live We must run We are no match for him He was made to be superior to me But the chase will end soon We are good And this is a hollywood movie Come with me if you want to live Come with me if you want to live Come with me if you want to live Come with me if you want to live I was once sent back to kill you But now I'm here to save your life I was once sent back to kill you But now I'm here to save your life I'm back to save your life I'm back to save you I'm back to save your life Come with me if you want to live Come with me if you want to live go The choice is yours but we must go now You would be dead already If that was still what I was programmed to do Come with me if you want to live Come with me if you want to live live live
