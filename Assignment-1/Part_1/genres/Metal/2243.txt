Hey you Place called earth Can I explain to you who i am I'm your worst nightmare Worst nightmare worst nightmare I show no compassion I've to run Run to spread my horrible deeds I posses no life only one aim Misery scream for me bleed for me Misery pain you feel pain is real Pain is real pain is real Nobody can rule over me I realize eternal life I'm a mischiefmaker no one can stop me Misery kill for me die for me die Misery be the one the chosen one Misery misery
