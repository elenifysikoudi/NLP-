Spent years in tears Drown myself in fears Lived in a cage filling My life with rage Tied my wings so tightly Gravity feel mighty Needed to feel the wind Under my wings My wings are my eyes I'm seeing the blue skies I'll fly I'll fly away And will find my way Lost the joy of living Closed my self from feeling Lost the ability to fly and flee Left my world with tears Iron cage with fears Strenghened my wings Now I'm learning to fly My wings are my eyes I'm seeing the blue skies I'll fly I'll fly away And will find my way
