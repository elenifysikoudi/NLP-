my black face in the shadow of the pentagram among the silent forests in the never existing town my fingers touched the sky I was god in forgotten times jesus and his servants were sucking my feet lucifer give me the power to rise now I'm fallen a down of misery among the blurs of evil hidden in morality I had power to destroy god my demons ruled the crowd now I can do nothing alone in black crypt satan give me the power to rise but there will be days when I shall rise a dawn of my kingdom slowly comes I will fight again will take your mind to sit on the golden throne somewhere in the sky belial give me the power to rise oh oh satan give me the power to rise
