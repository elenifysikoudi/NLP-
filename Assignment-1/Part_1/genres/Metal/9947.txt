Processed diluted Virtually unrecognizable I was lost there no direction A scattered void No more It's over I'm on to you Your evil game The tables have turned I am taking back my soul Tranquilized scrutinized Hate injected mind As if internal wounds Wouldn't bleed wouldn't hurt me I see through your lies Taking back what's mine
