Darling baby Don't say maybe Disobey me I'll be Like a bad penny I twist the truth I love your youth You're losing grip Take a trip you You're going down Going down You're going down Like fallen angels I will mesmerize You will paralyze Framed in your game Slowly fading No one knowing We are through Count your blessings Count to eighteen Souls to perish For a few stolen dreams only As we've walked down the alley On the misty afternoon No one looked back nor forward The city walls felt distant Never at our reach We're sentenced to your world You're going down You're going down With me You're going down with me I will mesmerism You will paralyze Like fallen angels
