Crumbling stone faces dismantle this praise Rubbing ash of conquest across faces of war Self imploding flame of birth Scorn and hate risen from ashes Diving the divisions of hell Dare to go where evil has no shame Revolting the presence of question Concealing this senseless bitter blood A hope for this landscape of terror for the demands of this retribution Raped soul of conformity Let the blood flow from these wrists Transparent emotion of rage as flesh tears in the fall of hope Reap benefit of gratifying torture Vast scape of crimson realms Welcome this dread of unknowing No higher vision shall curse my Thoughts of devastation Digested and forced This carnivorous state Of primitive killing Unleash hell's wrath Swallowed in blood and fire Assume the birth rite of murder Great genesis of reprisal Spreading great wings of war Taking the lives of this resistance To fuel the machine with endless carnage Prolong the expectation of faith in the jaws of fear Satisfied in this excavation of the heavenly womb Fed by flame nourished by death I'm eating the blood Tearing meat with teeth and nails The all destroying Devouring the hearts of the ancient ways A machine for the will of Satan Whose tongues bless in diabolic spite
