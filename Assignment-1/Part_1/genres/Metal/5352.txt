Here we are far beyond the distant sky Seen all the world and how the story will be over Through the snow and tainted mountains we have climbed Now we have found the light that guides us over Through the falling rain we travelled far and wide And through the blackest darkness stars above shining bright Through the sun and winter rain will fall All our lives we all were waiting for a sign to call We're walking hand in hand in dreams of endless time How do we know when we will leave this life behind Stare at life through eyes of mine The hate the fear and the pain There's a feeling held deep inside When life you live is in vain Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday We close our eyes to see the light of brigther days And all alone we'll be where time can never heal With the trail of broken hearts flying free Once again we walk this lonley road There are times that we were wading through the rain and cold We're lost in memories of what we left behind Relive the dreams the endless screams of pain inside Lives are filled with emptiness The fear returns once again Searching endlessly now we will see Drown your mind in the pain Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday We close our eyes to see the light of brigther days And all alone we'll be where time can never heal With the trail of broken hearts flying free The last temptation will be all that's left for me When I see those tears you cried When I hear those lies you lied When I feel all creation now falling down on me Is this the reason to be Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday We close our eyes to see the light of brighter days And all alone we'll be where time can never heal With the trail of broken hearts flying free
