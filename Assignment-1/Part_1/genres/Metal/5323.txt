Suffer the raging anger creeping below Trapped in the circle so helpless Forces beyond This is your last chance to die I hear a thousand voices screaming my name Dreams of a life forgotten now will be gone Never to return again Hide from the light you feel so hypnotized Filtered and disguised Burning forever try to remember Sadness in her eyes So many times now we've been here before No more illusions behind the open door Trapped within my fierce desire resistance is futile Screaming for your life nowhere to hide Tonight we cross the line your innocence is mine Falling down my life fading now to the end One last chance of glory in my heart again Set me free from craving the one thing I can't have inside of me But is it all a waste of time Lost in a misery the fatal demise Forced to a living that no one can understand Hiding behind all the lies A long time in slavery it cries out in vain Lurking around the shadows until the end Fearless in fatal disguise Wake from the dream the life you left behind Time to understand Lost in the laughter life ever after Trials of a broken man And through this madness a new day will rise We shall remember the pain she held inside Fear the pain inside my heart our sacrifice in vain Screaming for your life nowhere to hide This everlasting strain driving you insane Falling down my life fading now to the end One last chance of glory in my heart again Set me free from craving the one thing I can't have inside of me But is it all a waste of time Still lost in the universe we cry for a new day to come Break free from our loneliness the last time Pray tonight as we try to understand Falling down my life fading now to the end I'm alive forever my soul will ascend One last chance of glory in my heart again Set me free from this craving the one thing I can't have inside of me Just a memory Or is it all a waste of time
