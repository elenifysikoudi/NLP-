i have seen what it means to detest and to care and to outlive the dream of you and me this has been a disease overtaking a new sense of being pain staring from your eyes have we made a promise strained too far this lie the trust has been broken again and this path will never lead past the nightmare straight towards my grace not another fucking forfeit forget rising hate left to fear i wont be buried in here no buried in here now crawl into the shadows your power betrayed lied and wept a self destructive ocean displaced this torment and its dyin for destruction it will devour our pain just let it release this agony we cant control it some things were meant to be some things were meant to be just torturous pain
