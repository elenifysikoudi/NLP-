The world flows around me I'm not swimming in its currents As a rock in this muddy river Alone I stand in its floods I'm hiding behind a mask Doom rules my world Tyrannic king of my mind While I show up this smiley The reason of my despair Is your possible lost my love I can't help you're on my mind I can't help to love you Without you life is tasteless The flavours all fade to grey Without you light is darkness The colours all seems the same Wheat decays on its stalks Burnt inside like my soul Birds shot down while flying Down in flames like my heart Endless night on my mind Will obscure all my thoughts Forever my wounded flesh Will pour tears for you're gone I'm hiding behind a mask I'll destroy it for you Sweetest queen of my mind When you are mine forever The world flows around me I'll swim again in its currents When water becomes clear again When we are one for evermore The reason of my despair Is your possible lost my love I can't help you're on my mind I can't help to love you
