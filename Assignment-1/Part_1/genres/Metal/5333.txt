One man remains And the stars seem to change Far beyond our universe tonight And the cries of the brave And the skies filled with pain For the silent ones we pray for all tonight New dawn rising destruction and pain Long days passing the fear of the rain Soldiers fighting on the price they will pay Nuclear meltdown the world uncertain from the Power of the tragedy of man's creation Rise from the suffering for our salvation Fearless we stand strong till the end at the trial of all our lives Now say our final goodbyes Light the path for the journey home Save a prayer for the lost alone Find a way from the other side Before the heroes task still binding Through the long nights across the seas Shine a light for eternity Find a way beyond the other side Until the last man stands for all mankind Skies now blackened the night turns to day Nations fearful of global decay Fires still raging on in vain now we pray Nuclear fallout the fortunes fading as we Stand at the edge barren desolation Fight for the future of our generation Fearless we stand brave we defend For a thousand years gone by Now say our final goodbyes And the fate of the world in our hands Rise again until the end of time Until the last man stands for all mankind
