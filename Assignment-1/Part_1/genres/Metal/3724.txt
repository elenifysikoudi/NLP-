As the night sky calls my soul asking me to fly forever free seeing beauty in gracious darkness for all of eternity Serenade my Innerself release the walls that in turn bind me waiting in line to look upon a cauldron for something I may never see Can you hear the silence As it echoes From left to right through corridors My thought are cleansed No impurities The assay is passed Know not failure Seek the future for the knowledge Seek the knowledge for the future Find the past for the truth Find the truth in the past Trade a sect of your life for the piece of the puzzle you wish to find Like the Sphinx's great riddle a part of the superior masters rhyme Take the hand of the mighty priest to lead and guide me on my quest Stare into a deep black ring a gaze into everdark As the night sky calls my soul asking me to fly forever free seeing beauty in gracious darkness for all of eternity Serenade my Innerself release the walls that in turn bind me waiting in line to look upon a cauldron for something I may never see
