Angelclaw A queen of the night She reigns from her throne of stone Bringer of evil a destroyer of souls Do what thou wilt lust is her excuse She'll use you up suck you dry This beautiful creature makes you high Try to break the spell that is cast Bu she knows you all to well Angelclaw Effigy of a God long forgotten A sickening ritual She raises the chalice of blood The hunt starts again
