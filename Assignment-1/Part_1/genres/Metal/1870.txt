I'm the slave of my past More and more Life never gonna be Like was before I can't digest What I have seen Silence inside Makes me scream Hold me please Into your arms My damn journey It only starts I'm too weak to stop this painflow Take my body and let me go Voice comes from above Noise rips my head off A sign brings me bow down Lights go out in me I'm blind to see You come near to me My brain falls asleep To a dream so deep I feel your breath Burns on my skin I'm tired of this fight Where no one wins
