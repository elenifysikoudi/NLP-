Razor sharp I cut The bull from my life Too blunt your knife To slay this dreamer We might be dogs astray No running line will hold us So rather kick and kill me I'll be butchered all the same No words are spoken But the world is broken 'Cause I want something Something all wrong done A life instead of mere living Folding crumbling withering oh hell What difference when working the way The crown of my work Is what I shall gain At the end of my days Daylight awake to a puppet world No strings attach to this body of mine Folding crumbling withering oh well The punished pushed along the line All my actions all my moves A life all mine to lose The crown of my work A life all mine to lose A life all mine Is what I choose At the end of my days
