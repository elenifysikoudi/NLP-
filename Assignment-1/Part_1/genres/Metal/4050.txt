When I bring the stones inside and I lay them on the floor I hear the steps from other room Edel's coming from the door My son is watching me with strange look in his eyes His voice starts to chance and my heart turns to ice Years ago so I've been told That the blood of our enemies was put in his soul Now I have found seed of darkness he is bound There's no cure for my son or for plague that they have done There's no cure Listen what your heart will desire And protect all the stones from the dark You can't fear the unholy fire Or the evil will know where you are Seed of evil has been planted years ago Before the birth of my man from darknesses hand Just pure evil they infected their souls They tainted Amardon also Delinom Evil blood is running through their veins Can`t find a cure to remove all these stains Those times before the sword everything was fine No one knew about it's source or the power what it causes Times when I was God we were safe from the dark Now the blood from our enemies is controlling son Don't fear the unholy fire Or the evil will know where you are Voice of evil speaking trough my dear son Says that Your end is near the new king is here With great powers he strokes me to the floor No mom why Now you must die Last thing I see he's runnig out from the door Is this my own blood I see on the floor Those times before the sword when everything was fine No one knew about it's source or the power what it cause Times when I was God we were safe from the dark Now blood from our enemies is controlling son Is controlling son My son has betrayed me tonight Darkness growing I can't see the light There's no hope no faith for me at all Is this the time when everything will fall I lose my son As I walk down the stairs I can hear that voice again Something flashes in my eyes and it feels like I'm insane Where am I going I don't know but something makes me walk I should stop but then those voices start to talk Years ago so I've been told That the blood of our enemies was put in his soul Now I have found seed of darkness he is bound There's no cure for my son or for plague that they have done Now all is vanished the whole universe will be gone If we lose the stones this land will be undone They can rule the elements fire earth wind and ice They will destroy everything and we have no chance rise My son has betrayed me tonight Am I dying I can't see the light There's no hope no faith for me at all This is the time when everything will fall And I'll lose my son
