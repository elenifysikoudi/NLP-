driven by ribbons you were such an instigator using all my pencils to carve up my paper i was over you were over we disintegrated i asked to look inside of you cause you were cut wide open always tryin to hide the side of you that wasn't broken under the impression we get it from each other the sighing time was almost over you backed up to run in place shielding spit with your blinking face both my arms were torn from the ends of the earth pain was the middle and pain was just the point of it time was never saved my time was just an argument i traded you my world for two or three or two my new heart didn't ask for the kiss that you over zealously gave her aimlessly i look for words to say to return the favor pain was the middle and pain was just the point of it time was never saved my time was just an argument i traded you my world for two or three or four
