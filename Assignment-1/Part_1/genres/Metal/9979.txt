Sands of time Running through my fingers My life slipping away And I feel nothing Swallow the tears Eat the pain It's worth the degradation Eat the pain Behind the smile I feel nothing I reach out to touch but I'm not really there This reflection in the mirror Can't reality be me I see no connection With who I wanted to be Drink another glass Swallow these pills At the end of the rainbow You take the bitter The bitter with the sweet When love dies The angels cry Here I am Alone Alone in a crowd
