"My mind has been building worlds Where as a king I reign or lay in slavery I take the dust of Gods To hold the divine sand ""To see a world in a grain of sand And heaven in a wild flower Hold infinity in the palm of your hand And eternty in an hour"" ""The mind is its own place and itself Can make a heaven o hell a hell of heaven"" Lost in a dream I wander in my Realms I don't want awake Forever in this place I don't want awake From a distant landscape Forsaken in this space hidden by the fog I can fly away dreaming of my kingdom Lost in my dreams I wander in my Realms Forsaken My mind has been building worlds Where as a king I reign I'll take the sand of Gods Or lay in slavery ""To see a world in a grain of sand And heaven in a wild flower Hold infinity in the palm of your hand And eternty in an hour"" "
