april was spent wasting my time april was spent baiting the line a weekend with my fingers frozen and that's when i finally touched you don't lay your judgement on me i hear you praying for indecency we waited to climb in i begged you to hide my pistol in a bone is a bone a bone is a bone break a few for me i am still alone everyone cry cry for what you don't know i'm a mess of it a pitiful clone notice how you stain something you can't paint and all alone in a minute i've grown so weak with two dollars on my dresser i've been to embarrassed to speak i wanna go slow don't lay your judgement on me i hear you praying for indecency we waited to climb in you hid my pistol in policy is all that you know
