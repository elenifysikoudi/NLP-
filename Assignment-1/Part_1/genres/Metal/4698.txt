i sat down in the dirt i was born again with a pain in my back received and sent a sharp reminder of my favorite approach he spat in your face and he expected a note he was a golden boy i was a problem child the blood of god is staining my hands can we sit and cry a while i beg for position like a broken seam a permanent argument for another man's dream i bit down and tasted myself deep in you with steel in my teeth i look to the sky and said if this is free then i won't take it my forgiving tongue remember when i made it with my broken heart i said i'd look over you how numb are we how numb are you blinking lids on hollow faces saw this empty situation this misconception we painted on a postcard simple and naked i'm the savior that betrayed you i'm your maker i display you if this is free then i don't need it you shook your head i gave you someone to bleed with you promised every breath i took that i'd look over you a subtle smile that i never had a bleeding heart that i never had i owe nothing to you i only suffered with you if this is free then i won't take it my forgiving tongue remember when i made it with my broken heart in hand i look over you over myself if i'm free then you won't take me how impossible do you have to make me with my broken heart in hand you look over me over yourself
