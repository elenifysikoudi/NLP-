How did we get here Where is the silence We need to breath in How can you sleep when war is all over We are walking on fire We were sinking desire I am leaving my past You are changing at last Why did we go there What were we thinking We need to breathe out I need to break through 'Cause war is all over Shiny hours seem far Seem so far away We are walking on fire We were sinking desire I am leaving my past You are changing at last We talked and talked but no one spoke We laughed and laughed but no one smiled
