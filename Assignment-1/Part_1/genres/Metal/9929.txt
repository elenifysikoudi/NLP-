A precious child with an innocent mind Born to suffer in this life or for another So hopeless and relentless falls this remorseless day The dark remains of a violent world The day you died my tears ran dry I feel you I hear you echo in my soul I failed you I miss you so The day you died echoes in my soul This world's on fire turned its back on us A lost horizon left behind So hopeless and relentless falls this remorseless day The dark reality of a hostile world The day you died my tears ran dry I feel you I hear you echo in my soul I failed you I miss you so The day you died echoes in my soul The day you died my tears ran dry I feel you I hear you echo in my soul I failed you I miss you so The day you died echoes in my soul
