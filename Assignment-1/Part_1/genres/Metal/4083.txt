I'm burning like a fucking fire Mysterious Domain Murdered Apprehension Shemyaza Lacifarus glow like the Sun In this final hour Ov Dawn ov the Dusk I heart ov all chthonic hearts Vulture eye fallen one proclaim This great world Is a mirror ov my small self Striving for infinity shall I remain We cannot kill the time It is the time that kills us And I'm the answer on my questions And blood ov my hopes and all prayers Mark the sunset the last judgment And my rainment This is the night just black damn'd night As dethroned so enthroned attracted Rejected In this totality is perfection ov Me in Thee Freedom ov Nature delight ov Existence So intoxicate me as I intoxicateth thee Slay me as I created thee When reality is nothing more Than quantum vortex deep sleep Make it lucid dream Or hallucinate if you please In exaltations ov All One None There Is No Difference We are the First and we are the Last Io Pan
