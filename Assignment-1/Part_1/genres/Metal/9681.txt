Ashes my trusty bed Unhurt me now if you can filling the skies splendour Provider so sue serene now maudlin now bellicose no souvenirs minion Lead me to life star spangled eyes Turtles and doves filling the skies Lawful offense lustrally spurts Never repent the harvest that hurts Aging without time in this paradise of self defence you need treatment barrows Silenced when two as one cross the barriers of violence have confidence ashes Follow your kind star spangled heir rockets and calls filling the air Wash up and walk into the night stale souvenirs memories that bite
