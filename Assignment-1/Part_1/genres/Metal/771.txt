Somewhere in time there was a dream A dream I felt deep inside That no one could understand Where do I go now When will I find my way All The Lies I've left behind Seem so far now from my mind Now I take I look inside what's left of me From the life that once was mine I tried to heal the wounds of time Never really did believe the lies were real From beyond I'm reminded of a memory Now its gone into the gray of the moment Where do I go now When will I find my way All The Lies I've left behind Seem so far now from my mind Now I take I look inside what's left of me From the life that once was mine I tried to heal the wounds of time Never really did believe the lies were real Where do I go now When will I find my way All The Lies I've left behind Seem so far now from my mind Now I take I look inside what's left of me From the life that once was mine I tried to heal the wounds of time Never really did believe the lies were real
