To view the world through the bottom of an empty glass These blurred images of smiles of so called friends You're so tired The weight of the room is set to strangle Her arms go limp and so she closed her eyes This always happens in the night It happens every single time You feel the turning of the knife In your gut and neon blinds your eyes Sing the song of sorrow The past is no tomorrow Starting now there will be a brand new day Cut deep scars bleed These wounds will heal The memories will fade away You said the nights were too long But with bloody knuckles we carried on You said the lights were too bright In your eyes and sang your sad songs We buckled down and broke the bottles spilling dreams across the street Erase the images the pitter pat of tiny feet Sing the song of sorrow The past is no tomorrow Starting now there will be a brand new day
