Soldiers of fire Rage of the universe Cold steel and bloodshed In the lost barren wasteland Fear rising higher Rage of the winter war Death calls at night fall Our hatred still burns as We march through endless skies Mankind will fall death will arise For a lifetime we fight without reason Still we wait for the warriors return Though we're cast out and broken we still carry on Alone in a lost fallen world Woah yeah Flames burning higher Curse of the winter land Black torn and twisted In the fast fading twilight Storm winds still blowing Steel shapes our destiny Death calls at night fall Our curse with be lifted Disguise this timeless crime Brave men will fall evil will rise Still heroes we're born with promises so blind The light at the end of the road that we all must climb climb For a lifetime we fight without reason Still we wait for the warriors return Though we're cast out and broken we still carry on Alone in a lost fallen world Alone in a lost fallen world Woah yeah
