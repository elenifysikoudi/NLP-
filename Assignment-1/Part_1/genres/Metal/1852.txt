If you get to know The deepest feeling You'll know well what pain means When it's about real Inner suffering That bothers you til you're down on your knees It hurts to lose someone But on the day of reckoning I'll be right if the fire lives on in me The one who gives me faith I'm gonna get power I'm gonna get a friend inside The one who helps me To find the right way The one who surely stands on my side Beside him in the night Thousands of souls Are shining bright So I cry up to the sky I cry up to the sky You lead me Oh so far away Hand in hand entwined But the road Came to an end for me All that dwells in the present time Overhead From the distant sky I hear you quiet I see you light I can go no farther Just walk alone To the place where silence borns Big companion Yet big solitude And sorrow is yet more and more Everything disappears slowly Well known faces are greeting me As I reach the end of my road At the gates of another world At the gates of another world
