With just a flick of the opal banded finger I will throw you into a Concentric mental decline I control your elation I control your depression I take as I wish memory clothed in a raiment noir I take you Under my black wing I take you under my dark wing and nurture you in hate To dwell forever in a Maison Blanche Purity through corruption who am I to Blame when your basest instincts are realized
