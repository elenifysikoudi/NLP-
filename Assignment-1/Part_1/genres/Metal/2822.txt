Astral skies burning with embrace Fourth of the flames lost with the winds Storms from the north like a calling blaze Whispering your name Condemning your sins Dance with the shadows In a landscape of ice Water and wind clutched by king frost Silence winter silence So the storm from the north Has losts its flames forever The call from the mountain top Can't bring you back again
