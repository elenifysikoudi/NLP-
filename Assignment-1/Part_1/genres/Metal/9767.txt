Step aside and turn around We forget the crooked past Gather up the guilt within And pour out this my everything A new seed we've now found The time has wasted it away Look beside and all around For they are everywhere No souls but still I've hope We stand cloaked in our pain This the dance of silent lives And rising on our blackened will We are handling life to her This hope will never leave alive Rule of blood and old Forgive the rule and blood of old For law and ethic were yet untold Rule will form as conflict grows And men will drive the courses of hate as force untolds Clinging on the Faith and Dirge We Fold unto the longest road As sure as stone and black as coal We drive the blind in darkness bold Behind the Drained and bloody smile A man whose view is now on trial Will the blackened force of men or the dream Pump this heart again
