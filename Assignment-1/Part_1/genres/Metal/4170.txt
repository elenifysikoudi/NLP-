Behold bastard son I am the evil one No glory to be reached No more thy slavery The passion I besieged Spawn terror Smash thy will Ye pale dominion fades away my Will dominates And watch my star arise Burning up the earth Sun the eye of gods Threw into the space Watch ye moon eclipse Falling from thy grace Watch all nations cry All feared of his name Praise the flame Watch angels falling from the skies Praise the flame I killed thy god My will is done Thou art lord Rise me rise me high Lead through the gates of sun Rise me rise me high Where angels do not dare to fly Invite to feast of gods And let me drift away Leave flames of infamy And watch me kiss the stars
