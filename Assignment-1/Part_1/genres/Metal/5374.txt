"""Uh we got a killstreak coming up if anyone's interested "" It's getting late at night by a freezing moon The time is running out and the end is soon An army in despair don't know what to do Impure thoughts are raging in this empty room The victims are escaping now we shall regroup The times are getting tougher as we face our doom A circus of horrors waiting just for you The barrel's bottom anything will do So take my hand and I will lead you right into Extraction zone the zone You can make yourself at home Extraction zone your zone You don't have to feel alone Where dreams become reality And standards will now cease to be So live your life in the extraction zone Another place another time we carry on Not getting any easier cause we're getting on A creature from another world it's gone all wrong A circus of horrors waiting just for you The barrel's bottom anything will do So take my hand and I will lead you right into Extraction zone the zone You can make yourself at home Extraction zone your zone You don't have to feel alone Where dreams become reality And standards will now cease to be So live your life in the extraction zone As a new dawn will rise I promise myself not again But deep in my heart The fire still burns just the same It's just the same A circus of horrors waiting just for you The barrel's bottom anything will do So take my hand and I will lead you right into Extraction zone your zone You can make yourself at home Extraction zone the zone You don't have to feel alone Where dreams become reality And standards will now cease to be So live your life in the extraction zone"
