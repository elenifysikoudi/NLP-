Shadows are gathering to put a spell on you They promise you fame You get hypnotized You don't care that they fade the sunlight away You just shut your eyes shut your eyes Something's gone wrong can't you see you're alone Mangod Show me what you've got Take a wiff of the breeze learn to live learn how to feel What goes around comes around Can't get off with impunity Sun will show you what needs to be seen What goes around comes around Welcome to reality Why don't you hear it it's loud like a scream The music you're listening to is full of fear So many times you seem to be lost The walls that you built from concrete are for real At least you should feel my eyes are unsealed
