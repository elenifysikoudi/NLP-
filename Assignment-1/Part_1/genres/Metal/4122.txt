"The son ov morn What made me so divine I transcending ecstasy through ecstasy I who am eternally defined by my Will Behold I am the spawn ov downcast Ariman Awakened yet am no longer human Kindle me to Thy rapture As I descend into Sheol Hiva hear my call Transform my flesh into flame Hiya hear my cry Sustain my being in million fold forms Our creed the living flesh Our law trespass all the laws Since NUIT is our refuge And HADIT becomes our light All stirs within Tis chaos in and above me In the world ov nether nether ""I"" infinite space is all consuming Behold I am unending The consciousness ov ""I"" shines universally Unbound by wretched dogma I spew my will forth Hell is democracy All things exist in me I believe in naught save myself My sermon steadfast and proud There is nothing but god in me All things stir in me With joy and suffering My sermon steadfast and proud There is nothing but god in me "
