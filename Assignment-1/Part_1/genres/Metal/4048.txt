When I'm sitting and writing in my book I sense the shadow behind me can't look I take my knife and I turn around I will rip out the heart from your chest I will cut your throat I will send you to hell Out in the Shadows I've lived all my life Now it's time for revenge this is a good day to rise Through the daylight and darkness I rode with my troops Now this day has arrived when I will not lose I will fight I can feel the beat of my godly heart I feel weak and I'm falling apart Everything is dark I can't see the light My last battle has turned into unfair fight I will bury your corpse in the grave Any last words to say This is your final day Out in the Shadows I've lived all my life Now it's time for revenge this is a good day to rise Out in the Shadows I've lived all my life Now it's time for revenge this is a good day to rise Through the daylight and darkness I rode with my troops Now this day has arrived when I will not lose Out in the Shadows I've lived all my life Now it's time for revenge this is a good day to rise Through the daylight and darkness I rode with my troops Now this day has arrived when I will not lose I will get my revenge
