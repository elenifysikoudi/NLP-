I am at the waterside My cold feet are numb And I follow my dream I want to cross I want to get inside The clouds make a circle On the soil that I'm on And I trust what surrounds me I want to cross I break the storm through the clouds I'm at the other side I watch time pass And I see I have to go along With the water that will lead the way And I feel the rain on my head And the drops hit me one by one
