As I sit here high upon my throne guarded by these seraphs of mine sifting through the battles that take place While choosing few throughout all of time Many men will die in rage of war time hoping to find their way to me silhouettes of lost souls caught in someone's struggle ever to walk aimlessly Valhalla Glorification to thee Valhalla Honor to be forever free Slain in the course of a conflict will the courage displayed suffice As he lay there motionless in wonder none to soon he will surely see This time this place this one shall not go for his story shall end in vein For this will be his last sunset and his dawn will end in only pain Pain Time after time I watch the fallen All of them hope to hear me calling Enrich their lives only after death calls soaring into golden halls There is one now of noblest blood prepare the journey to pass into heavens of everything you could ever dream to come to me and I shall greet you Starring up at the gates made of pearl you have reached your destination Forever to live in true nirvana in place of damnation You are now with us partly of god Immortality you will know forever more You are now with us partly of god Immortality you will know forever more Many men will die in rage of war time hoping to find their way to me silhouettes of lost souls caught in someone's struggle ever to walk aimlessly As I sit here high upon my throne guarded by these seraphs of mine sifting through the battles that take place While choosing few throughout all of time Valhalla Glorification to thee Valhalla Honor to be forever free Starring up at the gates made of pearl you have reached your destination Forever to live in true nirvana in place of damnation
