I break the chains of unbelief Burden of millenial slavory Forest eternat wander Extending beyond earthly dimensions Gods will return to their graces together with me They'll find their oaken kingdoms as before I free my powers when yelling silently When I fight thousands of demons follow me And my strength and my spell And my beautiful pride Will find and wrap you will raise majesty to the skies From the depths of the earth deep and black Through the forests woods and shadows It Will penetrate lakes and wolfish mountains On the wings of demons to skies I denude golden gates of my Nawia Shrouded in thick smoke of burnt bodies I show my love I praise the might And destroy with the power of thunders constantly destroy On my right hand fire eternaly devoted Together with the strength of thunders Will dance as before The conflagration death and misfortune let it beget Rebuild what was ruined Destroy what was created by the cross And my strength and my spell
