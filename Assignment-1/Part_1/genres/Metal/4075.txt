Inflict the seed of Eve upon me The heritage of Cain can't be undone This my rejection this my denial That stirs with repulsive mortifications They attempted to deprive me from my odium of chaos They threw my wretched body into rivers of purgatory For such is a consequence of my angelic nature Abortion of god in my leprous womb Soiled with the miasma of the bleakest hemisphere The formless fires of Amenti unfold Not nearly as frenzy as Discordia that breeds within Not nearly as frenzy as disorder that I bring Universe is drained so is my heart This earth grew weary and dull Is it the renaissance of my rigid existence Is there a future for me beyond the stars I drink to desolation I drink to your demise Monarch of neglected kingdom Oh great despiser of life Et credo in serpentem Misterium mysteriorum In nomen eius Baphomet Hearken my Ophites Consume the flesh and drink the blood Obtain communion with utmost disgrace Reject the benefits of Eucharist Disdain the lie let you senses sharpen Let your eyes see in the boundless dark Resist not radiant light Be like comets slashing through the vast skies Be like ravening wolves unchaining hearts Now drink to desolation Drink to god's demise Monarch of neglected kingdom Oh great despiser of life O leo et o serpens Qui perditor perdes Sis valens nobiscum
