The torture won't part you Motherly breast won't warm you You fail and foam from your mouth why is it so loud this sound All the sense your are capable of does not seem to save you You heed the glance of a smile Was it impossible to float for a while Restless is carrying fever burning you to pieces In search and need of a friend Will I bow down to this in the end I lay in the hands of my maker and I want to spend the rest of it awake Why do I get the feeling they'll break it It's a fight it's a fight The torture won't part you Mothers lap can't seem to warm you You strain stand up and frown Why is it so loud This down All the sense you are capable of does not seem to save you You heed the glance of a smile Was it impossible to float for a while I lay in the hands of my maker And I want to spend the rest of it awake Why do I get the feeling they'll break it It's a fight it's a fight
