flames reflects in my eyes the wildness and hate are born I draw the magic signs in the air the pride act of holy bastards burnt here's no more place for them there's no day only the moon and the night I turn into ashes all the holyness I destroy the altars of contempt with my sword then I hide in a blackrain naked trees the depths of the forests are my home as the wolf I appear this night as the wild dog I'm howling with lust for blood and hunger I'm the warrior of the night obsessed by hell bringing hate pain and desire I observe the blackwitches of beauty protected with the shadow of my sword they gave me the wisdom fed with blasphemy they assist in my every journey my heart belongs to them at midnight I call the winds of mayhem the power of the horned evil protects me I see how jesus tears mix with angel's blood in my visions I observe how the skies turn to black with the upcoming fire
