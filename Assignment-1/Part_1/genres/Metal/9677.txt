Frogs croak frogs croak for all From the dark grass outside you can hear them call Satan is laughing he is laughing at us all Look at the toiling little man and then he's destroyed for no reason at all The meek shall inherit the earth when it's dead When all temples are ashes and the soil bears no bread Frogs croak frogs croak for some From abysses begrassed the end will come In the flickering of the light Satan comes to take a bite Of what could have been my soul but it's all turd of mole And fouled by blind diggers I can see how it figures You can't have what's not and that goes for the lot
