Lead Nergal reptile Spreading sickness and disease among the men Grubby creed What are ye but the soulless meat Lunatic Cancer consuming Thy race from inside Beware No grace awaits Thee in the crying skies above I'm on my way Destination hell By the power ov will I shall complete The devil's work vultures attack May hell unlock overpowering might Mourn not my comrades Thou art fateless in the blinding light Soldiers On the altair of liberation crucify the whore Rejoice Drink to crucifixion For oppresion is no more sly the whore Make it bleed Make it weep Let id die forever more Slit the throat Let them rot Let them pay Let em taste their own blood Make em crawl Upon this corpse I shall feast 'till no hope remains for the twisted mob Mithras Raise thy sword of judgement loose the iron rain Beat the drum No earthly power May hinder nor stop Thee Sekhmet Manifestation ov Mut Protector ov Ma'at I call upon the most divine To spew forth this infecting dust ov life I'm on my way Destination hell By the power ov will I shall complete The devil's work
