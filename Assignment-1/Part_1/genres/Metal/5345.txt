Dark clouds and thuderstorms in the fires and flames were born Through darkness travelling on the night Hellfires and rain will fall time is coming for us all Our journey for the guiding light Firelight it is burning so bring in the dark of the night As we fight for the glory tonight there's nowhere to hide On the wings of your destiny brings all the power you crave Carefull now if not you then who else will we save Lost in this world a total stranger Death by the sword a common danger You know that everything is not what it seems March on all night forever searching Daylight ahead is only lurking Break through the walls and use the power of your dreams Once in a lifetime take a chance at the right time the dgolory you see Rise up for the time of your life Now the time has come for you to be free In minds of society we all live in harmony Truth is that we all die in vain You stand for what you believe I kill for what I concieve Is there then a title for this game Far way in the wastelands of hell full of torment and pain Demon knights riding over the heights where fallen are slain Violent fury of firestorming death now no life will prevail Now you live all your days in the fires of hell Lost in this world a total stranger Death by the sword a common danger You know that everything is not what it seems March on all night forever searching Daylight ahead is only lurking Break through the walls and use the power of your dreams Once in a lifetime take a chance at the right time the glory to see
