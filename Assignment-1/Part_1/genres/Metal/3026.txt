Such a sick site brainwashed millions Minions following their leader eating Up its propaganda Terrified of not Having their answer in a world Where people are so blind These Greedy fucks control their minds Inbreeding ideals for the weak I wont follow blindly your faith wont Bring you shit The cold reality is that We are born to die no one has The fucking answers past this life All the lies that you hold so sacred to Be truth Are nothing more than a plot To control you Religion enslaves the Minds of Those to weak to think For themselves Sedated with their god The price that you pay is the life that You wasted Living up to their standards Blatant hypocrisy Your answer for Tragedy Your life is a mockery If you are scared to think Of living a Bullshit free life of non conformity Then Bow to the Deity Gods are mans worst creation
