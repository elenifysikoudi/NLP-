Morning rise hear the crow this the last all things shall know Asgard will fall reduced to ash cities crumble none shall pass Trembling earth starts the trend now the final days end Ragnarok we will see ragnarok this will be Touch of ice begin to show Unyielding cold winters breath As harsh as three but only one destroys the rest Gods awake the time has come All to war all the same Destiny no escape none to blame Break the bonds loki's rise lead the march the gods demise Ships set sail meant to be of dead men's nails upon the sea Undead shall hear legions deep the masters call they will meet Ragnarok we will see ragnarok this will be Touch of ice begin to show Unyielding cold winters breath As harsh as three but only one destroys the rest Gods awake the time has come All to war all the same Destiny no escape none to blame Surt no longer waits alone deep beneath his fiery home Fell the fire searing heat Burn the world Underneath the ocean depths rising up with the rest Spew the serpents poison over Land and sea Heimdall guardian and watcher of the bi frost Shreds of hope are all but lost Hear the great horn blow Gods take up your weapons ride unto the heavens Now the once blue sky Shall burn in flames Watch the earth sink beneath untimely death under the sea No wind shall blow no water runs just to feel the blackened sun All that's left nothing nothing is everything Ragnarok we will see ragnarok this will be Touch of ice begin to show Unyielding cold winters breath As harsh as three but only one destroys the rest Gods awake the time has come All to war all the same Destiny no escape none to blame
