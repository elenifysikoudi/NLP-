Disenchanting and contagious when we think that we're in love Superfluous disengaging when we think we are in love Pointless words when it comes to push and shove We're just kids in grown up bodies right I am right aren't I We thought we were in love This love is the tie that binds A noose around our necks You created me to love so much deeper than that Please let me fall again I'll never come back We can fall just one time It still hurts in rewind You can heal broken hearts And replace with spare parts I keep my heart in my pocket It's weighing my shirt down Bleeding through the fabric and bursting with the sound What if my heart beats too fast I'm longing for your still small voice Viens bloom with blue like roadmaps We fell against our will What if my capillaries won't stand and lapse We fell against our will Honestly honestly Would you say those things to me Get on your horse and ride
