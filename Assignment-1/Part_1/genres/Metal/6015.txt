I gave my life to you and I've worked so hard at it too Would I do anything other than to raise you to be The finest men After all these years of ploughing through the weeds I have turned wise and grey With every fibre in me I have lived to see you grow to be The finest men I just followed my trail and I found my way back home In this light of all I wanted to display for you I will never leave you alone In the corners of this universal sky The completion of the day passes me by As long as the ways of the light Will reach your bearing hearts I will find The finest men I came and I saw I will understand this freedom And remind you of me Will you pass me on My pride I found in life my way home
