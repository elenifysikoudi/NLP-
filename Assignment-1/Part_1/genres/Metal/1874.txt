My question is simple with me or versus me My body's with me my soul is my enemy We dance together on the last night As evil and good collide in my mind Closed in a circle like blood in vein I can't runaway and it makes me insane Pain in my lying sins Fear in my true belief There's a forever storm inside Let me go or my soul tears apart I'm divided into wrong and right I hate this fight I lose my mind I'm only a tool of life In the hand of destiny I personify its plans He'll kill me as he'll be ready I play you dance You play I dance He plays we all dance You can't get I can't get We can't get out of control On the last page in the book of life I dance with you whose face is mine Dead souls invite us for guests On their faces there is blood and rest Closed in a circle like blood in vein I can't runaway and it makes me insane Inside me thousands of demons They don't let me rest in peace I'm divided into wrong and right I hate this fight I lose my mind Drag me left and right they mangle me Please set me free they're killing me
