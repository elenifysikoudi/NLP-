I cannot run from myself the man inside knows me well Wearing thin wearing down my heart is bleeding out My hands shake as I hold this weight Of another hard molded face without a name The reflection of myself goes much deeper within So I bury the shame of my past underneath this old calloused skin Will I ever see past the man in the mirror Is it worthless for me to think that I will ever be anything Rip off this facade of shame its haunting me Break inside overcome myself break out of the mold Throw down the cast of the world on the ground The broken mirror before me the jagged glass at my feet Ten thousand faces of uncertainty lay in the bed of defeat
