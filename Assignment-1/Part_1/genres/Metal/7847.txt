Spawned from the Prime Material Plane Sent to punish nature entire The reptilian destroyer has been sent By the Gods to end this world He is a scaled biped A true killing machine With two horns upon his head and a lashing tail He has claws akin to steel And a reflective carapace He'll trample the weak under and foot His name is the Tarrasque He sends fear throughout the valley Though dormant half the turn He arises to annihilate the ancient ways of old His chest shall wield 100 gems and his body 10 magic shields His scales are like pure rock forged from the deepest Abyss Immunity to the heat and cold The weak shall paralyse with fear He devours from endless miles around No shadows from his sight Enshrouded in mystery A hideous abomination of God From the Elemental Princes of Evil A gift of no return A demon in a silver skin a legend of forgone years The Tarrasque shall live again In the form of one whom is black The blood of carrion shall fall And devour holy flesh This land shall be cleansed of filth For he has the force of twelve His powers remain intact the ancient myths won't die Spirit of a long forgotten past Leaving nothing in his wake Scaling the timeless landscape Destroying all with his bestial hate The horror for six is nigh The task is at hand The acts of mortal man are crushed by his fury and hate
