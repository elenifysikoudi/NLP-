Hiding in the fog Where darkness meets the moonlight I will sing a melody til the morning comes Living for you only Take my hand and show me There will be much sorrow when the morning comes Fearless I'm fighting the pain burns inside of me Find the forces of my soul No one can understand me Am I condemned to ride the blackest night alone Tragic painting on the walls In this castle where affliction reigns So many died in vain Hear their distant cries Never again This is my symphony My dark blessing falls from the skies I hear the voice Rising from the void Of the memories gone by Dark is the path for me I'll find my peace another way Under the stars where we'll shine again some day Torment and sadness unleashed through these corridors Fear is leading to the night Bloodline of vampires doomed to fulfill their need Once united by the light Father Look into my eyes I shall kill you tonight to avenge All those who died in vain Hear their distant cries Never again This is my symphony My dark blessing falls from the skies I hear the voice Rising from the void Of the memories gone by Dark is the path for me I'll find my peace another way Under the stars where we'll shine again some day This is my symphony My dark blessing falls from the skies I hear the voice Rising from the void Of the memories gone by Dark is the path for me I'll find my peace another way Under the stars where we'll shine again some day 'Til the stars where we'll shine again some day 'Til the stars where we'll shine again some day
