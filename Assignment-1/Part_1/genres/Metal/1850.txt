The vulgar eyes of a mindless Crime Are looking at you till the end of time Your mind is filled with hate You are your own slave can't escape When you're all alone you feel the same old pain in your brain falls a deadly rain You have no choice you've to play game with The mothafuckin death is the only exit To kill somebody it's not worth the money To kill somebody it's not worth the trouble Lobotomy they are not on your side Chemical will change your mind When they get you it means your death Your freedom is a weapon don't forget It was just a minute the pain lasts forever The last smile of the death you won't forget it never deep in your souls resounds the silent scream You'll see the dirty blood in your every dream
