we set our sights on something that's just beyond our reach it's not what we expected we will pray we won't stop this we will not let it go we wont stop we're not letting go we wont stop we're not letting with every flaw in our hearts break with them on and on and on and on you say that's the part we won't break down and die tonight die tonight we're something we're something now something now you can kiss and tell but we won't back down you can kiss and tell but we won't back down we can feel you in our heart you will we can feel you in our heart we can feel you in our hearts
