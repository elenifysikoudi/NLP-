From long forgotten eons At sunrise thou shouldst come Desired for so fucking long Ascend at my command Surmount the sea Throw open portals of life And scale this endless mountain Of grace and of tears Oh voice unspoken mourn unheard Abandoned heart so desolate Rise Bow down before the kingless throne When sun is yet to rise Consume this putrid sphere Forever and beyond When heavenly chants mute Thy apparition I behold Oh Venus the sweetest of them all Let me bathe in thy divinity Descend And Thou hast descended Depart not yet I crave for warmth of blissful rays And fateless eyes encourage me The ancient's dreaming The wolf's unchained Disobedience has such a victorious taste Rise Bow down before the kingless throne When sun is yet to rise Consume this putrid sphere Forever and beyond Solo Nergal growls Rise Bow down before the kingless throne When sun is yet to rise Consume this putrid sphere Forever and beyond Forever abandoned among gods Since I have been made of flesh And yet I challenge Thee Canst thou hear my battle cry
