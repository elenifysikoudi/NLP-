I won't listen to your lies any longer Stop making excuses when you Know damn well you're wrong Just come to fucking grips with your reality Your words have plagued me all my life For Far too long Your life is yours to control Weakness is purely choice Answers that you are searching for Are all within yourself useless fuck Your words mean nothing to me Save your breath Your words are meaningless The time is now your chains are fake You're not held down Break away from this shit Don't look at me for sympathy I've seen your ways ill let you rot I have Bled my scars My wounds have healed I have moved on What hasn't killed me has Only made me strong And I won't listen to your Lies any longer Your life is yours to control Weakness is purely choice Answers that you are searching for Are all within yourself The time is now your chains are fake You're not held down I have bled i have my scars My wounds have healed I have bled
