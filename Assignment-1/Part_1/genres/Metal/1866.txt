Nobody knows who I am behind this mask of mine I don't wanna hear you askin me you will never know The fire that burned you through my eyes has you Under control and won't ever let you go Everyone feels it's in the air yeah you can feel the vibe You don't need to ask me about it Take a look around A new breed so strange prepares to rearrange your life You are stuck in the past but now your future is mine Nobody knows it But everyone feels it You gotta kill me cause I'll never let you break me It burns and it burns and it's light turns me on This time I won't let it out of my world I'd rather be burnt than to be frozen Set my soul on fire Set me free Nobody knows what's that growin under the skin of mine I don't wanna hear you askin me you will never know It wants to get out come to life help you to reach your goal You'll never be the same anymore Everyone feels it's in the air yeah you can feel the vibe You don't need to ask me about it Take a look around Hide the light in your eyes The spark of life will Burn the world as it will explode in my mind
