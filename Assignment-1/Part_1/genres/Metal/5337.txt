Close your eyes hear the thundering rain Here inside of the torture and pain For the cries of the world and the last lives remain Hear your heart's way to die for the game Deep inside slowly fading away And the last breath's in vain and the fear turns to rage Locked in the world by the fallen evil souls Torn right apart from the roughly seam Breaking my mind now to bring my life to war Reach out and die with the flames See through the lives of the red hot stabbing eyes Now is the time to defend your crown Destiny will call to remind us all We fly free so far from here there's one thing we'll relay And dreams of everlasting pain the fallen now rise again Through the fire through the flames like the sun we'll rise again Lost in time lost in space to the end of other days See their endless ways insanity The quest will rage not meant to be In flames of hell forevermore eternally So free your heart leave your life far behind In the cold dark winter skies escape the pain inside Now feel your soul lost in scenes of all eternity Every day of this life defending And the flames of youth not ending In a lifetime searching we must fight through the eternal pain So alone in the world far away memories of the dream will remain As the world's falling cold and your life's all in vain Fire in your soul will forever rise again Nothing in your mind to remember now Held here by the fear of the dark land calling Fly free on endless seas the final curtain falls On the ground from down below the time to lock and to load Through the fire through the rain far across the distant plains Feel the wind beneath the steel as your mind becomes insane Save the hate of all humanity their eyes belong to destiny For freedom now we rise alone again So free your heart leave your life far behind In the cold dark winter skies escape the pain inside And when the memories are all left behind And the days are gone forever lost within my mind Now feel your soul burn in scenes of all eternity Every day of this life defending And the flames of youth not ending In a lifetime searching we must fight through the eternal pain We fight through the eternal pain
