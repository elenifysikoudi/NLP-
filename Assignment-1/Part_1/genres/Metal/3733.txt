I am always I am forever Time I know not death is not brought Judger of all my wrath shall fall I am shapeless I am deathless Known by many names never feel pain Infinitely existing Where is the light where is my god Shoe me a light show me my god Searching for the ultimate reality Looking for the father the deity Knowing I am the giver of all life Asking where is the one that gave me mine Searching for the ultimate reality Looking for the father the deity Knowing I am the giver of all life Asking where is the one that gave me mine I am boundless I am soulless No end I shall see all praise go to thee For all eternity I shall never see Searching
