Come wind come icy storm come thundercloud Rise ruthless tempest and make lightning strike Wake up You in the bowels of the earth tremor the snowy fjells with all my hurt Run now run you fool Your fate is to be doomed Lonely is the end of unfaithful one The price of what you've done To make me feel so numb Is to pay it all back with your life Come wind come icy storm come thunder cloud Rise ruthless tempest and make lightning strike Wake up You in the bowels of the earth tremor the snowy fjells with all my hurt Run now run you fool Your fate is to be doomed Lonely is the end of unfaithful one Now my aim is clear Your payback time is near Run to wilderness I'll find you The winternight is harsh It leaves no one a chance With no pity I will leave you here Run now run you fool Your fate is to be doomed Lonely is the end of unfaithful one
