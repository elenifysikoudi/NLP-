The first day of battle we've changed who's in charge Muskets and courage you all start to lack The heavy stream of cavalry too much it's too large The first line is broken retreat and fall back Fight the rebs Kill them all Try to cheat death The metal hook is laid atop both hill and each hill In a flash of steal you try to react You've been shot but still rack up kill after kill Your nightmares alive the flank they attack Fight the rebs Kill them all Try to cheat death This line must not fall Hold your ammo is low Charge bayonet attack Roar louder than the guns Die you won't live again Artillery and deadly fire seems to save but yet dims You fight and you die for your life and your land Honor the fallen and the worst loss and win But the Devils Den is where your live and your life and your death begin Fight the rebs Kill them all Try to cheat death This line will not fall
