Every living thing will bow down at his feet And every enemy will suffer their defeat Our deliverer has come This is war Our history has led us here Creation sings in celebration This is war This mystery's beheld us here He is the voice of liberation Now is the age of redemption Prophesized by generations past a redeemer for captive Israel Our Messiah has been sent at last to take the throne and shut the gates of hell We fight for justice the war has just begun Our king has come now Now I see freedom I see it rising up like that star after sundown With a voice that shake the heavens and with words that calm the seas there is one the prophets told us that the nations would receive This is what we've been waiting for Rise up Never again do we fight alone The promised one has come to set his people free From the ashes came our greatest victory This mystery has been revealed to the discerning The Lamb was slain The blood was shed Let death pass over us The sacrifice was made for sinners undeserving Now we stand set apart to storm the gates of hell The fight for justice it has just begun our king has come now Now I see freedom I see it rising up like that star after sundown With a voice that shake the heavens and with words that calm the seas there is one the prophets told us that the nations would receive This is what we've been waiting for Rise up Never again do we fight alone Rise up We are the resistance Rise up Now is the time to rise up
