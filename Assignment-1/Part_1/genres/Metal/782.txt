Did you know the past Did you know that it holds the key To the part of your mind That unlocks your memories Future fades too fast Fades away from you and me Will we be the last To find the truth to the greatest mystery I know a place just follow me there And I will show you what lies ahead A different space out there somewhere Between the living and the dead The Best I Yet To Come Our work has just begun The road that lies ahead Will lead to brighter days Don't be afraid to try I know you're wondering why But in the end you'll see And you will believe Some things just have to be In the final dance Will you take a chance with me Call it happenstance Call it out destiny The Best I Yet To Come Our work has just begun The road that lies ahead Will lead to brighter days Don't be afraid to try I know you're wondering why But in the end you'll see And you will believe The final moments have begun OUr world is waking up We take the steps to build upon It's time for the world to see Let's take a chance before it's gone And tear the castles down We'll chase them all out on the run And set our spirits free
