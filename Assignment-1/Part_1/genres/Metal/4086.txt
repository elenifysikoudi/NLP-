Music by Nergal lyrics by Nergal In the forests of eternal dreaming Old oaks lighted up by the fullmoon's light The coldness of dungeon touches the inside of wooden maze From the womb of the mother wolf I was born The witches foretold in the hearts of my enemies In the midnight wilderness I took a pledge Quickly I fell in love with the taste of steel For ages waiting for its denudation The final triumph The pure barbarity I howl to the moon for support in my battle The moon symbol of purity the essence of beauty I damn the sun rising again and again In brightness of bloody light steel holocaust I received hails from the northern side of snowcovered Carpathians The light breath of nightmare as a sign I summon the iron powers cavalry of my brothers From the land of armageddish fields I am the bard of eastern lands I lead my brothers for death struggle In glory of victory my armies rise Barbarian tribes with fury of destruction With axes reach the sky hiding usurpator in their wings Call the clouds desecrating all the holiness Hurt bodies on the snow Pandemonium burns This battle is a rebellion rebirth of old traditions Mythical hell is the paradise to the true warriors There they attain eternity and sit high on the throne Pagan nations became united Mighty bards received their long awaited silence Slavs returned to their villages and woods Pagan frights of heavenly hell dispelled I opened the door to the higher than stars knowledge And took a long walk throughout the unknown dimensions As the sign of fullmoon in damnation I shall rise
