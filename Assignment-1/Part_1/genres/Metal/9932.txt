This earth speaks of darkness To come in the blood of man The air breathing poison All waters running black Until the sun rises and sets on death The sky burns red like sheer hate The light in our eyes will fade To join the darkness of our souls The earth is losing its light Night falls fast Watch the dying sun We are lost No angel dares to land In this hell of mankind's making Buried all beauty in our foulness Nature begins to shine its fury Until the sun rises and sets on death The sky burns red like sheer hate The earth is losing its light Night falls fast Watch the dying sun Night falls fast upon mankind Pray for the dead The sky burns red like sheer hate The earth is losing its light Night falls fast Watch the dying sun We are lost
