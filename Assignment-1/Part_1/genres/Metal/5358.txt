Day after day as I bodies slay And the sun becomes dark in the sky Everything's lost for this human race And the dawn of a new age will rise Rays of sunlight now are gone Only visions of ice will remain The fallen ones and forgotten souls Will rise up over the slain No more hope As we raise our hands to the sky No more dreams As the rivers run dry Everything's lost all is left astray Only sorrow and sadness remains The curtains have dropped on our fallen world And the forces of darkness shall rise Why can't you see what has happened to thee Can you not open your eyes Everything's lost there is no retreat And the valleys echo with pain No more hope As we raise our hands to the sky No more dreams As the rivers run dry On the endless sea of madness we sail forever more And the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores When the flame has died forever we stand one and all With the power of the almighty sword We fight the battle on the fields tonight To save us from the master of all evil sign And to the battle on Forever standing strong We feel the fire power of the night warriors No more tomorrow Dying of sorrow Over the mountains and up through the trees Traveling across seven seas No more hope as we hold our hands to the sky No more dreams as the rivers run dry On the endless seas of madness we sail forever more And the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores When the flame has died forever we stand one and all With the power of the almighty sword We fight the battle on the fields tonight To save us from the master of all evil sign And to the battle on Forever standing strong We feel the fire power of the night warriors On the endless seas of madness we sail forever more And the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores When the flame has died forever we stand one and all With the power of the almighty sword We fight the battle on the fields tonight To save us from the master of all evil sign And to the battle on Forever standing strong We feel the fire power of the night warriors
