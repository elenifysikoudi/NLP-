I will never bow down to your idols I know who I am You'll have to put me in the ground to silence me This is my final stand You can't kill me I'm already dead This is the martyr's cry So as the crowd demands my head My time has come to die You can't kill me I'm already dead This is the martyr's cry So as the crowd demands my head My time has come to die Death is only the beginning Of everything I'm living for This is my final stand Laid upon the altar This is my final stand Laid upon the altar This is my final stand Stand up my convictions are not for sale And I know who I am They can't deny the truth inside me So I will suffer at their hands Dragged through the streets like a criminal By my own flesh and blood Guilty by association There is hell to pay for this apostate son Kill him the self righteous scream He serves a new king Kill him their blind eyes can't see I serve the true king Now the rocks start flying And my mouth it fills with blood I can hear my mother crying But one voice is not enough I was facing the full wrath of hell feeble as it is I was facing a good death as well this is glorious Face to face with the grave I was waiting for And now my killers were Face to face with a faith they can't ignore This is my final stand I will never bow down to your idols I know who I am You'll have to put me in the ground to silence me This is my final stand You can't kill me I'm already dead This is the martyr's cry So as the crowd demands my head My time has come to die You can't kill me I'm already dead This is the martyr's cry So as the crowd demands my head My time has come to die
