Open your portals infernal lord Oh great opener of the way come forth hear my calls Blast ye forth through the gates unholy master Spread your wings fly then high into the blood red skies It's time to claim your rightful domain Send out your black winged horde through the night Defend their lord when angels strike Unholy war thunder roar angels blood falls to the ground Satan lord through the night he flies holding high Their impaled Nazarene son covered in blood and his Jaws agape his eyes aglow with the fires of hate Satan lord through the night he flies Holding high their impaled Nazarene son Covered in blood and his jaws agape His eyes aglow with the fires of hate Once again the dark age will rise worlds set aflame By your hellish hate no more feeble Christians ever Will reign burned into eternal fire in your darkened domain
