for I feel as fallen pain scold myself with useless blame drag the blade across my lips purge the lie release my fist as far as I as one have come as for my lies I burn in each and every one as for the truth denied by fear and for my pain I brought it all upon myself this fear that I may de my dream success means I am more than none to be as one is what I fear in days of hope I dream I'm dead to be as stone and still my mind as I rise to de as one my past this life I leave as filth it all comes together when we open up our mind open wounds will kiss me dressed in blood meet my god
