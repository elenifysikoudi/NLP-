The shape of all my doubts My fear Come closer Trust me Here I stand in the falling rain There is no joy inside these tears I see the world through a twisted and bitter stare To be where I have been to see what I have seen Is it a dream Or can I believe The memories will haunt me for evermore The shape of all my doubts My fear Come closer I trusted you I am not the man you used to know Why I am different Why Everything is different now When you left me you planted a seed of hate in me Nothing is stronger Stronger than this
