I take less than I can get You take more than you need There's no standards set Let your hunger justify your greed You seem awfully proud in your genocide Carrying on your back those who died Much safer to use to test After all they're just pest No need to get upset Not important just forget Millions killed for this glory Murder never seemed this gory Kill em all Give the profits to us Just as long as it's food on our plate We won't make a fuss
