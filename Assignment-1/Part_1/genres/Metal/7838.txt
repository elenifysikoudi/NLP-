Scathing flames black as the night Transform into a powerful shape Black warriors in a cursed land Are embraced by the winters dusk Unholy trinities form beneath the stars They shall return from beyond these gates Horror and pain infect their skin As he steps from the mist Screams of pain sweep the enchanted lands By the red moons of Mordor Furious winds caress the robes Of the nine horned beasts His mortal foes are but destroyed From the ruins do they arise Savages from all foreign shores Will hear their tormented cries The flames of the fire contain nine darkened hearts All weak skin they wither and transform Unleashed powers as the ring is restored Eternal cremations where death is their strength The hymns of mourning and sorrow embrace the once world Pure evil forces infect these bitter winds
