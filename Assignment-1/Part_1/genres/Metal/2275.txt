I see blood flowing like an endless river Red is my blood pale becomes my skin I creep like a snake so as to reach my last bottle Like a painter with is picture I spread my own blood on the floor Cruel god why don't you end all those sufferings Why are you so cruel to me you're a sadistic Let me join my paradise where freedom reigns Stay in your wisdom of hypocrisy Let humans decide their own destiny They don't need your rules they are stupid And then I plunge into darkness
