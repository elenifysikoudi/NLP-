" Now that darkness has arrived And the moon is only light I'm crossing this line To the land which soon is mine And I'm fighting for my pride With this sword by my side Cryon's warriors ""go hell "" I can hear the winning bell The winning bell I see how all my men are lined Only give them one more sign And they are heading to fight To fight for they right And I raise my sword up high So high up the sky My troops on their way This is a glorious day I ride and send my troops into fight Soon they all will sing for victory My troops and sword will help me on my way And I'll rule this world eternally Eternally Now that daylight has arrived And I see the end of fight I have won the war Now it's time for second door To Fedoria I must ride I'll be there before the night Maegon must die He has no place to hide I ride and send my troops into fight Soon they all will sing for victory My troops and sword will help me on my way And I'll rule this world eternally I ride "
