Outside on a winter's night as the rain begins to fall There's a chill in the air and the howl of a wolf while the rain beats at the door Seven kings will ride on the wind up towards the mountains high And the only sound that will break the air is the warrior's bitter cry When the dawn of a new day will see the light then the strongest hearts grow old And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow Dark night with a glimmering light in the distance up ahead In the forest they dwell with a misty spell no one heard what once was said And the eagle fly through the clouds while earth bleeds dark and cold When the voices of men will ring out again all creation shall unfold When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall Hoping for a better day never giving in Until we find the words till we find the words to say Until we find the words to say Burning starfire shine in the sky For the lives of great men who stand by your side When the night fall on we will ride For no lost souls will live on forever Dark night on the valley below still the horsemen follow through It's a forest that leads to the foot of the hill that inside the magic holds Seven strong they ride on along to the place where sorrow lies And the shadows of the night will no longer hide all their mysteries come undone When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall Hoping for a better day never giving in Until we find the words till we find the words to say Until we find the words to say Burning starfire shine in the sky For the lives of great men who stand by your side When the night fall on we will ride For no lost souls will live on forever And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall Hoping for a better day never giving in Until we find the words till we find the words to say Until we find the words to say Burning starfire shine in the sky For the lives of great men who stand by your side When the night fall on we will ride For no lost souls will live on forever For lost souls will live on forever
