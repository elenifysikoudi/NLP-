The eyes are made to see They see the paths of our lives The heart is there to feel It feels the energy of our time I can see it I can feel it This is my waking hour This is my place I can hear it I feel the power in my heart And is my moment It is right there And it's staring me in the face Disguise and make believe I see the end of all demise The only way to heal Is in the honesty of your eyes The fight is done And who are we to judge What will become All the iron armor Is laid down away Followed by the heroes Who belong on rested earth we pray We feel the rescue coming near Within the woken soul to hear we sense the calm all wrapped in fear And all the while we heed The senses way too vast to see We beg of you to not let go Our names will provide us with a soul Falling down Start again Life can bring you down The monumental truth Of elegance in you Falling for A part of who you are Makes you shine inside
