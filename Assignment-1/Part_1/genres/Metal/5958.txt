I'm waiting for your hands to fold around my wrist I'm mellowing in warm grass And the scent of you I've missed And blue is representing The draft in my heart I'm wandering through thin skies And the transparent air I've missed Pale is my face You might want to colour while I breathe I'm following large drops of rain With my eyes on the sight of you I've missed
