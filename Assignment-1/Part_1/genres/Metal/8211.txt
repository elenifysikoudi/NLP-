I have found the grey pestilence where my hate was born and through the veins of misery the battle is flowing within When my tragedy was forged in Blood The Pain and Anger rest and waited for the Centuries of Conquering to come as I awaited in the Inner Temple Run to the immense horizon coz I'll find the real Betrayers destroy every feeling of their weakness For my kingdom I've built in Blood Drowned in the Mournful Blood The Pleasure to deform the time I'm bonded with pride and Strength coz I'm Drowned in the mournful Blood
