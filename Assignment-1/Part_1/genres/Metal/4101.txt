Ov circus my world wise man call'd Ov drunken trickster bed And not violators of thoughts They're for life is a theater In which actors all we are But when curtain is open There is no time for any reh's And as all lights turn'd on were And the first act is begun and the last My mouth I opened I purple sage in the universal And I spake in tongue unknown And behold all stood in flames Su na'aq tem kah Chaph keb ngaa Sul tamed mes No sedem cha'no Umes maog etem Chaph keb La'at qia sulib And hardly ye remember dark November days When received ye rain ov sulfur When earth came apart under thine feet And wasn't it rage ov thine god And wasn't ye his Sodom It's only lough mine empty Sob silent and helpless gesture
