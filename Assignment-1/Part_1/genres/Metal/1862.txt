My body sinks through thick mud I wanna grasp something but just cannot I fell my end and I see myself dead While the waves dask over my head Gasp for breath sink deeper n deeper The light glimmers hardly and much more paler My body grows weary I don't feel pain Every trouble seems to be far away Life before my eyes No one can tell me lies I will see the secret The question Is it the beginning or is it the end The press of the mud is embrace now I don't wanna be back and don't know how I lost the sight of light I can't see the surface My new home is the restfull space
