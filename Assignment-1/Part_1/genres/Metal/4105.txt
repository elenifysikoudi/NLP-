In my church of disbelief It canst get no better When days turn from black to grey In church of indifference So innocent in their guilt Perfect in their imperfection Let my children play In my church of liberation When doubts and fears wither away I stand alone vs the world In the church of man Where god is trapped in human flesh I never pray In church of pain I spoil none but myself Yet my monologue's unheard In my church of hope Yearning for Thy sweet embrace The waters of Styx I have crossed In this church of sulfur rain Flaming mouth of Sheol In my church of broken word It's so little that I ask The brightest of the days The darkest of the nights What once was I wish no longer be Fear of separation is no more One cosmic breath the whole eternity Unbroken flow of awareness conquers entropy
