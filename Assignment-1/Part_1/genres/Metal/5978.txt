I have an injunction don't look surprised Time to get even in this unproved life Questions all over the years I live Time for some answers beware of my drift So on be true denial won't work And there is nothing you can't do A feast arises be glad you're invited The future has no past pass the wine All those worries about all those dreams All those nights when I screamed Captured in security a babbling brook Let's drop a bomb and act like fools But a true feast arises when you're done And you're done when prospects are gone Cause when you're down in the mud cause dreams won't come pleasure is gone what did you do wrong And you're trying to gain the fortune and fame of the ones you admire don't try to remain Security is just a game
