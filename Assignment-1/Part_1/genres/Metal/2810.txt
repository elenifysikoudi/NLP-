When daylight's gone the beauty's still left Preserved for eternity by the love of the night A sunset of embre a rose in the sky Kiss of the sungod farewell to the world The skies are ablaze with the loss of the day And will be again til the morning has come Bring on the night its beauty in black Enchanted mistress I'm held onto its grip Days of darkness soon to arrive Blessed to the beauty of the sunkissed land When daylight's gone
