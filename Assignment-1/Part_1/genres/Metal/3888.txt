after all this lasting vision so great so small there is only one thing left to say i will i will i will im out of the woods and into the swamp but i will trudge on to make it through please dont forget promises cat out of the bag cos the bag is torn words flow like water on to the page heres the last stage im making promises i will be the one to lose i will be the one to lose this time carved into the trunk of a tree into my tombstone i will be the one lose this ventriloquist is feeling sick another dummy parrots the words but tries to keep yknow so i harmonize in threes and fives pushing the sevens into last place to save some face to keep my promises i will be the one to lose i will be the one to lose this time carved into the trunk of a tree into my tombstone i will be the one lose
