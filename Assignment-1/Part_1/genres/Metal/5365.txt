Sonic fires bring mass devastation Manic search in sad desperation Jeopardise the right to hide from a sad existence Nothing left still searching for something Deep beneath the cries Wait for the deafening silence fly forever more Crushed by the thought that you're all alone cravation in her eyes I will be waiting tomorrow Striving to understand wasting a life not meant to be Twisted and so broken once again And the promises we cast away will shine a guiding light Victim of your grief and denial Take my hand this one last time Face the world before us the warrior inside In a lifetime of disaster it's a battle to the end Final stand my life must carry on And forever this time Battered beaten forced to submission Stricken by your fatal decision Suddenly it's time to say your last goodbyes Misery remains voluntary all illusion gone Break through the blistering madness Free forever more Blinded my eyes with your filtering mutation cast aside I'll still be waiting tomorrow Stand to a toxic man forced to a life of yesterday Theatre of salvation crushed and burned Down this lonely road recede the day our dreams are brushed Can't regain this emptiness in time Take my hand this one last time Face the world before us the warrior inside In a lifetime of disaster it's a battle to the end Final stand my life must carry on And forever this time See through the skies Far beyond the road tonight Here the sounds of freedom ring In a silent dream and a million miles away See through the skies far beyond our world tonight Hear the sounds of freedom ring In a silent dream And a million miles away Reach for the stars And live our lives forever free In our hearts for a thousand years And a thousand lifetimes before And the dawn of a new day will rise a light for us all
