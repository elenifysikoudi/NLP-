they want your heart they want that I'm apart that I'm apart pounding life they give me names swear words and pain at night wake night be bathed in sweat pounding life in the morning I catch a sight of pounding life no will to give me bad names pounding life no way to love me pounding life isolated from life feel the pounding life
