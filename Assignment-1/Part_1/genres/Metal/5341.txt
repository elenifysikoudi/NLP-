Bursting through the fires of empty Fatal warrior battles are raging Power of darkness rise for the fight We're strong and stand our ground Death is all around us and my heart is beating weaker Fight the demon power of immortal souls arise Fire in our hearts the evil rages on for evermore Burning in the cold the battle rages now Through damnation rise sign of the times Master of bleeding eyes Thunder and high look to the sky They're never gonna take us down And we will cross the evil standing On the temple in the fire Storming there beyond the lost horizons oh Heroes of the night are calling See the promised land is falling Reaching for the powers deep inside On through the night Blinded by the hate and desire Burning in your heart like a fire Challenging you suffer and fear Horizons seek control Blood spills all around us And our enemies grow nearer Sacrifice your life to have The journey you will ride Take us to the plains of death and carry on for evermore Riding on the wings of memories long gone And you'll die for your crimes sign of the times Master of endless lies Fight to the end now we ascend Together we will take them down
