Scathing attacks of time and torment When we Sleep walk our lives away these thieves They've made Our hearts break So now I'm screaming Attacks of heartless horror At them their cash cant kill us all and We have built we have we have built upon their dream to long Don't be their fucking slaves We live in exploitation We have worked blind endless means they have turned our failure into what they need So Break these shackles and take a stand we are the gears we are the ones they fear take their crowns away They wont take away my life a slave no longer in my mind I Break these shackles and take a stand to tell the world The revolt returns Break these shackles and take a stand to tell the world GET UP We live in exploitation We have worked blind endless means they have turned our failure into what they need TAKE IT BACK
