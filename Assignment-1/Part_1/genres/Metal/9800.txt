Where are they now these giants of my dreams The ones that seek to kill me They run and hide they see the fire behind my eyes And they feel the anger that boils beneath my skin Come out come out Come out and say something real Come out cause I feel the apathy in this air tonight Do you hear the wind The trees whispering their deepest fears to me They can feel the fire burning at their limbs Burning at their limbs burning at their limbs The voice of anger it screams in the wind The voice of anger blows in the wind Do you hear the sound of the nothing Of everything tossed by the wind The sound of the war drums beating on In the war for the hearts of every man of every tongue I see them coming down on the clouds the clouds of black The clouds of war clouds of war I see it creeping in I feel it creeping in I feel the apathy creeping in Where is your fire Where is your anger Where is your blood Where is your fire Where is your anger Where is your blood Where is your fire Where is your anger Where is your blood Where is your fire Where is your anger Where is your blood Where is your fire Where is your anger Where is your fire Where is your anger Where is your fire
