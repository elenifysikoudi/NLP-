"Dark thoughts rise up Deep in your mind The killing of hope The end has begun The locked psycho door breaks down The beast breathes freedom and fire Blows bloody thoughts into your mind Demons whisper ""COMMIT SUICIDE "" Weak is your body Helpless your soul The beast destroyed your will Left nothing but an empty shell Dark thoughts rise up Deep in your mind The killing of hope The end has begun Self destruction leads its way Your weapons turn against yourself Cutting through killing you A downward spiral the shadowbeast has won The shadowbeast calls A vulture of life Your worst enemy dwells From within Weak is your body Helpless your soul The beast destroyed your will Left nothing but an empty shell The shadowbeast calls A vulture of life Your worst enemy dwells From within"
