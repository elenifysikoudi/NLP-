"Moonlight rays awaken me From my eternal sleep I am not alive but I still breathe I ask myself ""how can this be"" The feeling inside is hard to describe I feel strong but yet so weak I walk into the night with a hunger so strong Something to eat I seek ""Pulses quicken piqued by the scent of blood"" Noooooooooooooooooooo That's when I realise I've become one of them Cursed to live in darkness never see the light of day It's the birth of a vampiir Strigoi It's the birth of a vampiir Strigoi Moonlight rays awaken me From my eternal sleep I am not alive but I still breathe I ask myself ""how can this be"" I've become one of them Never see the light of day It's the birth of a vampiir Strigoi It's the birth of a vampiir Strigoi ""Cursed to live in darkness never see the light of day"""
