It woke up in me I asked softly Leave me alone with a gun on my own My other self is injected in me Fatal invention I had to be With empty hands no fear no pain Neverending function wounded brain Infectious creature makes me sleepy Reality disappears into mistery The innocent eyes wake me up But the deadly dream enervates Immobile mutilated bodies Never will find the forgotten peace The earth quenches with blood its thirst Tears on the faces burn and hurt It's not my blame I'm innocent I am a part of a program Jungle fight rules my mind Maybe it will be never over Close to me Perfectly I am a Killing Machine
