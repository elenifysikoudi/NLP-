Wah Steel of the brave hearts trapped inside In frozen of illusion High is the mountain we must climb Reach out for rebellion Rise up to the open sky One chance at the price of glory Fire in a thousand blazing skies One lifetime ascending Strong is an army side by side Still brave and defending March on through the tragic lands Cold tears in the north wind falling Raise your souls high See the new dawn arise through the Sands of all time mystery of life Everlasting sadness through lightyears gone by Land lost in time once more back where we belong Promises of yesterday we'll keep holding on Silent and twisted lifeless mind So blind in delusion Cursed by the emptiness inside Cast out in confusion Strike back with the power in hand Break free from a past life dying Onwards we strive till The answers we'll find in the Sands of all time mystery of life Everlasting sadness through lightyears gone by Land lost in time once more back where we belong Promises of yesterday we'll keep holding on Still lost alone and I'm dying Daylight the world is still crying Evermore we'll search throughout a lifetime Stars are falling down tonight Light the path where eagles fly Find the strength inside us a new world reborn Silent tears of pain we cried Raise our hands unto the sky Break the chains that bind us One moment in time as we Rise up to the open sky One chance at the price of glory Raise your souls high See the new dawn arise through the Sands of all time mystery of life Everlasting sadness through lightyears gone by Land lost in time once more back where we belong Memories of life to pray for Everlasting price to pay for Promises of yesterday we'll keep holding on Sands of all time once more we'll rise up again Stand alone and fight til the end
