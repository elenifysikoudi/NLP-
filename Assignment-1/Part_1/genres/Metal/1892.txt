I stepped into the red room I waited for the time to meet Take me with you I want to leave this shit I feel you fill my body Please hold my hand I'm scarred but in a minute I'll be a strong man But why do you want from me more and more You didn't want to cause me pain before Do you like to kill Look into my eyes Would you like to kill me Why did you tell me lies I'm here again For the last time I promise I want your kind of feeling You can't leave me like this But why do you close the door I'm still here inside I know the Red room is my cage And you'll never let me out
