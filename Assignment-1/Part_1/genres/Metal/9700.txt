always is the time to eat watch yourself growing out of your seat watch the cherish of parental love flow all down the drain you used to be family's pride but the way you grew cast you aside pretty quiet slim and slender turned a lump of unknown gender dead ringing a montain of flesh a monster of omnivorouss excess too vast to be of human race monster fat and ugly must not be loved that's why dad is never home that's why mummy turns away they hate your ugly face eat and vomit starve and die they won't bother to ask you why they won't see you fade away this is the price the ugly must pay dead ringing a montain of flesh a monster of omnivorouss excess too vast to be of human race monster a monster of flabby flesh pathic revolting excess can't believe this a human face monster
