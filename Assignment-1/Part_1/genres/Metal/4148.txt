"Arrived we to the days ov our beginning To the City ov God clothed with the mists Enslaved by life we danced spinning In the taverns of time we used to sit And drunk with memories Dead moments glorified I saw the phantoms ov Golgotha Legion Legion Fed on dust ov dead Anoited by the grey ash Mad twisted mob ov Jerusalem Then Raphael beyond me and night appear'd Bent and The Word was announc'd An archangelic grreting Jetzirah Jetzirah The sign ov Portal reality ov nature Not to be but to become In aimless wandering across the time On the sea ov possibilities untouched I stood From my hand cracked heaven idols are falling to the pieces Reached the horizon Dagger in the air Sylphs work is done Oracles ov past aeons fulfill'd Live we on the edge ov the worlds In titanic turn ov time Here and beyond Carried on the wings ov the sun Infinite sacred power we call And sight hardly can catch the moment ov eternity When drink with light In light we will live And in the formless rapture Will we sing psalm ov Might The last spell ov Will ""We are one We are none """
