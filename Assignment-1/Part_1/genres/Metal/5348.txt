Full the moon and midnight sky Through the dark they ride Warriors of forever will sacrifice the night One for all and all for one The future time has come Faces filled with torment Your heart beats like a drum Never will you look back again You'll fight on til the end Together we will live on Forever more In this land we have defended from all things dark and cruel Now we are defenseless in a land where dragons rule In this land we have defended from all things dark and cruel Now we are defenseless in a land where dragons rule Flash of steel in the mid day sun The battle has begun Blood spills all around us but still we carry on No mercy we will show to them The white flag shall be raised We'll fight for our freedom Ride towards this evil place We all stand until the end allegiance to this game In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule Sun set in the western sky The battle's almost done The victory will be glorious Our enemies are gone
