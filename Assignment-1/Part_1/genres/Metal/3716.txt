Thus the story is told of the war of the rings Of the dark lord and the orcs and the foulest of beings Of the plague and the darkness that spread like a fire Of the eagles in the sky which soar so much higher Of the wizards and the dwarfs and the mightiest of all men Of the halfling and the task which carried all the burden Of the kings and the queens and the forest filled with elves Thus it is told on the greatest of all tales Beware the black hand reaching from above The armies of evil stretching like an ocean Wolves and men engulfed in a blood bath The armies of the virtuous will spread their wrath Majority of the war rests on he who carries the ring Into the mouth of the malefic king If the one is cast into the eternal fire The good will likely triumph and the world will again be brighter Fiercely fighting raging dying thousands slain cast down not in vain Day after day night by night mighty catastrophe middle earth has ever seen Thus the story is told of the war of the rings Of the dark lord and the orcs and the foulest of beings Of the plague and the darkness that spread like a fire Of the eagles in the sky which soar so much higher Of the wizards and the dwarfs and the mightiest of all men Of the halfling and the task which carried all the burden Of the kings and the queens and the forest filled with elves Thus it is told on the greatest of all tales
