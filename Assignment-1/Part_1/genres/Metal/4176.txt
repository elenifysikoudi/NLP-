Listen ye all who can preach I am the god's begotten son I tell three woe shall be no more Woe thou shalt end up in flames No horns I have nor pair of wings I am the balance of thy universe I have no number I have no name Not fear'd of laws Need to restrain Ancestor of all gods The one among the ancient ones Speak ye all who can speak Keep thy instincts ever alert Thou art the stars that shine among us And honor me as thee adore the sun And stand ye all brave and proud And watch the babel hill turn into ash Admire my shapes among the ruins of Jericho Behold my wrath I hath showered the earth Ancestor of all gods The one among the ancient ones The paynim right drew in my shade I am the one who begot the earth
