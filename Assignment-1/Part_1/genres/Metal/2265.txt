O painful life when will you decide to leave this weakened body to let my soul rest in peace O grieving heart when will you finally cease to beat and stop the stream that is flowing through my veins Disilusioned are my dreams My will to leave has expired Rotten are my last hopes Please death come and make it end Sorrow has replaced my joy So ephemeral in my life Abandonned is my spirit Once so strong in my dreams And loneliness is killing me Nothing is worth for evermore Now nothingness dwells in my mind Letting me rule the ruins of my life Buried now are my last hopes Please death end this agony Sorrow has replaced my joy So ephemeral in my life Abandonned is my spirit Once so strong in my dreams And loneliness is killing me Nothing is worth for evermore Now nothingness dwells in my mind Letting me rule the ruins of my life Je voudrais vider ce corps de tout ce sang Et purger ainsi tous ces membres contamins par la mlancolie Toutefois ma fin est proche car mon esprit a sombr dans la folie Oh funeste prophtie accomplis toi donc et dlivre moi de cette vie
