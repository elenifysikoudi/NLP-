So many tears have been flowering in my grave So many flowers have been withering on it Alone in this jail I hear the wind caressing my gravestone Loneliness is timeless and my sufferings endless Silence I can't stand it I hate It I feel the vermin swarming through my body My limbs are decaying like old fruits I'm doomed to stay here my soul is trapped Who condamns me Why What have I done Where is my god Anyone is perfect we all are sinners Humanity is what it is Temptation is human lust too Who has the right to judge us Neither a god nor the humans
