"Here they come the winged minions of the dark lord As black clouds they block the light of the sun By their side flies the king of the demon locusts The destroyer lord and chosen son of the apocalypse This for sure is the end of human race Thunder roars the abyss now gaping wide Darkness unleash it's armies upon the world The air filled with the stench of sulphur And burning flesh When the humans thought they had seen the worst of hell The ground explodes and fills the sky of dirt and shattered bone The necro lord rises from below Gathered stands the rest of his merciless horde The merciless horde The very few that might be alive will be taken by the flames The world is on fire the flames climb higher The humans erased Now on the site of where this slaughter took place One building rise built by the infernal race A monument of evil entirely made out of bones It's all that remains of the human race The world is on fire the flames climb higher ""A time lost to the pestilent horrors of a new demonic age"" ""Impaled atop the monument the tortured will burn"" ""Forever "" The very few that might be alive will be taken by the flames The world is on fire the flames climb higher The humans erased "
