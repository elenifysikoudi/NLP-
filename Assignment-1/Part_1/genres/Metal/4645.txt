Something is happening that I can't explain I can feel myself changing but I don't know why Something familiar that I've never seen A confusing sensation inside Beneath the human kingdom From the realm of dreams What does it mean Dangerous messengers start to appear They are threatening everything I think I have Threatening destruction of the world I made With desire to know my true self Beneath the human kingdom From the realm of dreams What does it mean Time to dare Face the end of all that I thought I was Face the change Signs of the mystery living in me Time to dare Face the end of all that I thought I was Face the change A long asleep giants slowly awakes in me Dreams Night after night I wonder what they mean Night after night I wonder what I'm seeing Night after night there's something haunting me Terror Now in daylight The terror I now see is real Terror The terror of leaving all that I know behind The promise and terror of everything is revealed The terror of leaving all that I know Time to dare A long asleep giants slowly awakes in me
