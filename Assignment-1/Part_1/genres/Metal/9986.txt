Set me free let me out of here From these chains to which I am bound Time was always on your side While my final hours slipped away Frustration in their minds The hatred in their eyes A new breed will now rise Damnation's way Losing my grip on reality Outside this cage I am struck by paranoia A paradox to all life's mysteries A never ending trail to follow I am the sinner upon damnation's way Always deprived of hope never to see the break of dawn My life I lived in the shadow of you The other side now greets me with open arms
