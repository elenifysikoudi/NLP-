Did her skin feel as soft as you always said mine are to your fingers Did her eyes look as deep into your soul as you always said mine did Did you catch the moon together When I saw the look upon your face I knew we had lost precious hours through our days On that day that you woke me up from our dream to your nightmare I didnt know it was possible to feel so alone being with you Will I find my way home When I saw the look upon your face I knew we had lost precious hours through our days
