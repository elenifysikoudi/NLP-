Where I am a land so disgusting I just want to destroy the dogod For all the deception I have felt for all the years I have lost I must reach the real Millenium I can create my own destiny Why I must suffer with no sense I'm the master of myself Kill Destroy Erase all the Mediocrity Blood must be shed with no Mercy Blaspheme and Puke in every weak one What god created man can destroy
