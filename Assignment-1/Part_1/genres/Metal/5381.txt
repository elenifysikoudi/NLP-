Her dream was to shine on the screen Felt that was why she was born Left all behind without a fear inside But sometimes there's no lucky star to help you Sun will go down and she's all alone Can't help but feel insecure She'll never stop the way to the top Is more than she had bargained for Her quest for the glory was real But somehow it turned out all wrong Heartache was never a part of the dream Can't find a reason to keep on trying Turn out the lights cause deep in the night Just like the thousands before Hold up your hand there's hope at the end But be careful what you wish for Now the lights are all gone You find yourself on your own Welcome the night cause not all that glitters is gold Now the city has gone You find your own way back home Keep up the fight and you'll find your kingdom of gold Another night out on the streets Finding a way to survive Wasting your chances destroying your dreams Counting the tears that you cried Hiding the pain that drives you insane But still you're craving for more So give me your hand hold on till the end And you can have what you wish for Now the lights are all gone You find yourself on your own Welcome the night cause not all that glitters is gold Now the city has gone You find your own way back home Keep up the fight and you'll find your kingdom of gold Now the lights are all gone You find yourself on your own Welcome the night cause not all that glitters is gold Now the lights are all gone You find yourself on your own Welcome the night cause not all that glitters is gold Now the city has gone You find your own way back home Keep up the fight and you'll find your kingdom of gold
