Everything I love has been taken I wonder what reason I have to live Desperately I have searched for a meaning Is it now time for me to let go of the world The future that I began to believe in Seemed so certain I thought it was mine That was where and how I would be living A complete human being with a soul That was only a dream in a nightmare And the nightmare is where I now live Empty life empty hours without meaning Hours of madness that make me let go of the world The revelation of my transformation Is both a shock and a comfort to me Leaving behind their conventional wisdom Their rules that govern the way I should be The narcissist and the father believing That they should be worshipped and obeyed By the lost overwhelmed and bewildered But for me it is time to let go of the world Why should I live by rules that I did not make So that people I don't know will accept me I don't care who they are These hypocrites preaching all of this nonsense Reject me they don't know who or what I am I don't care who they are Fight kill fuck eat fight kill fuck eat I just don't care who they are Fight kill fuck eat fight kill fuck eat I just don't care who they are Letting go of the world Letting go of the world Letting go of the world Letting go of the world Letting go of the world
