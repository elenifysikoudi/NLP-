Do you wish to be carried over sea To the banks beyond of the acheron Passage is that what you seek Passage admittance from me Obulus that is what I seek Obulus for you to proceed Passage is that what you seek Passage admittance from me Hermes bring them all to me those who seek eternity Buried with the proper rites thou shall suffice Breathing souls who wish to go present to me the golden bough Looking to the oracle cumaean sibyl A hundred years you may find a hundred years lost in time Cerebus not far behind lingering on Do you wish to be carried over sea To the banks beyond of the acheron Transverse the tides listen for the cries Of the souls below perhaps you will know Passage do you still seek this Passage assuming all the risks Obulus does not ensure the cross Obulus all you know may be lost Passage do you still seek this Passage assuming all the risks Precarious uncertain premises Precarious dependent on this Touch the water you shall know only sorrow Touch the water you shall feel only hate Touch t he water you shall see rancid plague Just just one drop Touch the water you shall hear screaming souls Smell the water's sweet scent of wasted life Feel the water you shall burn burn with fire Feel the water you shall drown in misery Just just one drop
