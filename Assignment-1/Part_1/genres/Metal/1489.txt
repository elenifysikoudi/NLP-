In the middle of the forest wild He's kneeling in front of a pond so wide Staring into dark and silent waters He joins the stream taking the hand of other See how your brothers lay in waters If you just let them hide their tears Shallow waters eating brothers Darkest whirlpool let me pass Stream of sorrow wide and narrow Let this sad soul pass your halls Shallow waters eating brothers Darkest whirlpool let me pass Stream of sorrow wide and narrow Let this sad soul pass your hollow halls In wells abysses he dwelled in dark and deep In the kingdom of Ahti he's the knight of eels Reclaiming from the stream my brother and my kin I'm reaching the great blackness that him binds See how your brothers lay in waters If you just let them hide their tears Shallow waters eating brothers Darkest whirlpool let me pass Stream of sorrow wide and narrow Let this sad soul pass your halls Shallow waters eating brothers Darkest whirlpool let me pass Stream of sorrow wide and narrow Let this sad soul pass your hollow halls Shallow waters eating brothers Darkest whirlpool let me pass Stream of sorrow wide and narrow Let this sad soul pass your halls Shallow waters eating brothers Darkest whirlpool let me pass Stream of sorrow wide and narrow Let this sad soul pass your hollow halls
