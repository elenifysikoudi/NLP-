I am a broken man My ways are like a fools Causing anguish causing death Creating waves of consequence Alone and in despair I wait for You I will wait for You here Pushing on pushing through it all I will run the race Setting my course straight ahead My destroyer waits for me But You redeem My destroyer waits You redeem me You redeem this tired soul And these tired bones Your name Breaks the shackles Your name Breaks the shackles Your face gives me rest Your name Breaks the shackles I see the rising of the Son I know the day is near the day is here I know my Avenger waits My Avenger is right behind me on clouds of glory I see Armageddon
