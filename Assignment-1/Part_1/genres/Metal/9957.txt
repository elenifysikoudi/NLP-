Lyrics Michael Amott The more I see the less I believe The more I hear the less I care This world we've created Has left me cold This world is sedated Dying in it's sleep I feel nothing Seen it written on a thousand faces The simple truth we fear Seen it happen in a thousand places Instinct brought us here The more I see the less I believe The more I hear the less I care We used to be the chosen ones Second to none Look at what we've become A pathetic excuse for life I feel nothing I can feel nothing Nothing at all Except for the pain That hits me again Again Lead Christopher Amott Lead Harmony Michael and Christopher Amott
