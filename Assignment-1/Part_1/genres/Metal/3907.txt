the guests have gone our hearts have beaten with the last song sung tonight resilience coursing through our veins we're picking up the pieces as we watch them fall like a cannonball we watch you fall bury me deep in this mausoleum bury me to my neck so i can't feel my limbs we're not going to make it not this time when you say that could you look me in the eye let's paint this town in a sheet of red and burn like passion in our hands we'll burn with passion we'll burn with passion we'll burn come on baby and just let it go
