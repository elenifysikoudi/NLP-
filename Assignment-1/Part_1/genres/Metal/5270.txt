Sceptical visions myths of a god Dreams from the future he brought us all far from religion living in hell Nobody believes you fucking mistake In is books he wrote forebodings and horrors The story begings now prophecies of our time The fire and the flame The nations waithing for the day A second opportunity All our fate is in his eyes It's not a movie time will tell human disasters that never end Announced forebodings Inminent war Battle and death spreading the blood In is books No a light in the sky
