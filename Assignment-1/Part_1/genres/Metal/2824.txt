Follow me to the place eternal Full of pain Pleasure and sin Come with me to a place nocturnal After dawn there's an open gateway To the place beyond and far After light comes the dusk forever Ripping chains tears your sould apart At dusk and forever Eternal pain in the darkest of domains At dusk and forever After dawn only shadows remains Walk with me through the darkest wastelands Where nothing grows but your own fear Come with me into oblivion After dawn there's an open gateway To the place beyond and far Follow me into oblivion Through the gates of pain and grief
