I felt so complete so alive always at ease You by my side never to leave I always knew you'd be taken from me Days go by and I'm left with the sadness Time chasing time leads to my madness Another place a different window A new path for me to go through Why did you leave me this way When all I ever wanted was just one more day In Your Eyes I see the hidden treasure In Your Eyes I see my life Take me on your final journey Take me back into your arms Why did you leave me this way When all I ever wanted was just one more day In Your Eyes I see the hidden treasure In Your Eyes I see my life Far beyond the light I feel your inner torment Far beyond the night I hear your cries Can you hear me when I call you Are you afraid of what surrounds you From beyond the dark I'll find you No matter what hell I go through In Your Eyes I see the hidden treasure In Your Eyes I see my life Far beyond the light I feel your inner torment Far beyond the night I hear your cries Take me on your final journey Take me back into your arms In Your Eyes I see the glory In Your Eyes I see my life
