my dreams are closed for your eyes my life behind a mask why can't I change myself myself Behind Those Eyes behind behind Behind Those Eyes Behind Those Eyes speachless tracks mark my lifetime where I've hidden in myself growing tired of living this way the meaning of life has faded away Behind Those Eyes behind behind Behind Those Eyes Behind Those Eyes I'll look the man the man behind the mask I look behind the mirror there is the mask hidden thoughts come to daylight a holding for these eternity a spark of hope in my life in my life this is my private story my story of woe I've to set free my inner voice how can I cure myself it would be worth a try where will it all end
