Lost in a dream finally it seems Emptiness and everlasting madness See the sadness grow watching as we know Blinded for our journey for the world Call for us the power in all of us So far beyond the blackened sky tonight Glorious forever more in us We are victorious and so alive We'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow Our journey on towards a brighter day Silent tears we left behind still so far away Across the endless sands Through the fields of our despair Dream for all eternity we stand yeah Rise above the universe tonight Starchaser Fly towards the storm see the world reborn Feel the pain inside the voice the sorrow Across the distant shores find the open door Stand alone in judgment for tomorrow Years of pain still haunt us all we saw the last sunrise Take me home in freedom for a lifetime Praying on for the silence and the last tears will blind So glorious this fight inside united we stand We'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow Our journey on towards a brighter day Silent tears we left behind still so far away Across the endless sands Through the fields of our despair Dream for all eternity we stand yeah Rise above the universe tonight Starchaser Free from this world here for the last time Oceans collide inside of us all Believe who we are The phoenix will guide us Freedom will rise once again Save us tonight the last hope for all of us Light years gone by we're still holding on Save us tonight a star shines in all of us Far beyond our lives still our glory lives on We'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow Our journey on towards a brighter day Silent tears we left behind still so far away Across the endless sands Through the fields of our despair Dream for all eternity we stand yeah Rise above the universe tonight Starchaser Our kingdom come we stand as one And we will live for always evermore
