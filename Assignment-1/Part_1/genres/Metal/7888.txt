When darkness is upon us and skies had turned to black When blood rains from darkened skies and crying angels die When the sun has burned its last rays and light no more remains When tears of god stains the ground the dark age has arrived Lighting strikes the realm of light Angels burn in flames of fire Storms from hell embrace the skies As blackwinged hordes arrive Infernal winds Come forth from the byss Satan rides the winds of wrath Across the blackened sky The dawn no more rises Across the darkened horizons Light no more shines Over the kingdom of damnation When shadows rise upon the earh and the horned one had returned When light has turned to darkness and heaven has been burned Lighting strikes the realm of light Angels burn in flames of fire Storms from hell embrace the skies As blackwinged hordes arrive Infernal winds Come forth from the byss Satan rides the winds of wrath Across the blackened sky When firestorms consume the earth And ashes is what's left Everlasting darkness Forever shall remain When the sun no more rises Over the darkened horizons When damnation is eternal The dark age has arrived The dawn no more rises Across the darkened horizons Light no more shines The dark age has arrived
