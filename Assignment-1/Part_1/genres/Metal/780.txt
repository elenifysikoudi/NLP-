As I look upon my life There's a memory of a child That I knew so long ago In a distant point in time We were once so young and free That's where I still long to be In the warmness of a love That was yours and was mine Sometimes when alone I still think of you Memories Of Another Time When we were young And the world was ours Memories Of Another Time We stood as one And we never faltered Running free under the sun Our days had just begun Carefree glances instead of words Not a worry in the world Hand in hand We marched through time From our childhood and beyond Every time I close my eyes You are all that I see Sometimes when alone I still think of you Memories Of Another Time When we were young And the world was ours Memories Of Another Time We stood as one And we never faltered One step that's wrong can throw Your world into the unknown One step that's wrong can throw Your world into the darkness One voice unheard Turns to silence in the void One wheel that turns is heard In the calm before the storm Sometimes when alone I still think of you Memories Of Another Time When we were young And the world was ours Memories Of Another Time We stood as one And we never faltered
