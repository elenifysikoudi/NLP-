I only regret chances I did not take And decisions that I waited too long to make There comes a time when you just realise Who and what really matters to you in this life Always connected but so far away The suffering and passion that we have each day Feeling the pain of the absence of you Each night we look up at the same sky Watching the night sky However far I am away from you now I swear that there is nothing that I won't get through Stars in the night sky can guide us both home To our hope and our truth and to where we belong Always connected but so far away The suffering and passion that we have each day Feeling the pain of the absence of you Each night we look up at the same sky Watching the night sky Always connected but so far away The suffering and passion that we have each day Feeling the pain of the absence of you Each night we look up at the same sky Watching the night sky
