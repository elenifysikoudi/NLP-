J Hall Are you still alive inside Can you tell one more time Tell me where to run Tell me where to hide I'll see you where you go I'll see you once again Try to not be slow For one more deadly sin Look outside The flames are burning Search inside The times are turning Look to the dark Your soul is running from you I can't wait to find More people of my kind They have to come quick Before we all get sick The lights are out And no one can see All that is wrong With everything around me Chorus
