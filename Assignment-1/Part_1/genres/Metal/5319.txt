On a cold winter morning in the time before the light In flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight And the darkness is falling down and the times are tough all right The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight Fighting high fighting on for the steel Through the wastelands evermore The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores On the blackest waves in history We watch them as they go Through fire pain and once again we know So now we fly ever free We're free before the thunderstorm On towards the wilderness our quest carries on Far beyond the sundown far beyond the moonlight Deep inside our hearts and all our souls So far away we wait for the day For the lights are so wasted and gone We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days Through the fire and the flames we carry on As the red day is dawning And the lightning cracks the sky They raise their hands to the heavens above As we send them to their lies Running back through the mid morning light There's a burning in my heart We're banished from the time in the fallen land To a light beyond the stars In the blackest dreams we do believe Our destiny this time And endlessly we'll all be free tonight And on the wings of a dream So far beyond reality All alone in desperation Now the time is gone Lost inside you'll never find Lost within my own mind Day after day this misery must go on So far away we wait for the day For the lights are so wasted and gone We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days Through the fire and the flames we carry on Woooooah Wooooooh Wooooooooah Woooooah Woooooah Wooooooooooah Now here we stand with their blood on our hands We've fought so hard now can we understand I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can For freedom of every man So far away we wait for the day For the lights are so wasted and gone We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days Through the fire and the flames we carry on
