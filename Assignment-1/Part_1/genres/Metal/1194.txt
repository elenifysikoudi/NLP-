"I've told you To live your own life Do it standing on this darken ocean We are in this alone In this moment we're untouchable Truth be told this is our home Swimming through life We still circled the shadows sifting through the water Feed on young and leave the old you can't be told To give it up to give it up to give it up to give it up You dumb fucks If you want to be the anchor to me then I'll gladly search far For a bag of rocks to tie to your feet drown you like the rat you are If the world is your oyster then I'll do what I can oh To drain the fucking ocean live you high and dry on the sand Without a doubt we're singled out They they never said this would come easy Take me hand and just believe me Live your own life Yeah Is it a crime to say All I ever needed was something to hold onto Why was it frowned upon When I fond that something to get me through This hate was grafted by the trends you upkeep trends you upkeep Well go ba ba ba back to the farm you fucking sheep If you want to be the anchor to me then I'll gladly search far For a bag of rocks to tie to your feet drown you like the rat you are If the world is your oyster then I'll do what I can To drain the fucking ocean live you high and dry on the sand Without a doubt we're singled out They they never said this would come easy Take me hand and just believe me Live your own life We are one but we are many We are one but we are many We are one but we are many We are equal and for tonight right here right now We are all royalty ""Live your own life "" I say it every fucking night ""Live your own life "" I say it every single fucking night "
