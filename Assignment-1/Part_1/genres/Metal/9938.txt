We walk through the ages The world on our shoulders The burden we carry To the dark end of our days A thousand eyes watching Every step we are taking Waiting to see us Struggle and fall And when we are beaten The cross holds us down I hear them laughing And walking away Carry the Cross And suffer the loss Hear my confession Forever damnation Reincarnation Bleeding forever Recover the pain Pain gives me strength Pick up the cross And carry it on Over and over The wheel turns again And when we are beaten The cross holds us down Ihear them laughing And walking Away Carry the cross And suffer the loss Hermy confession Forever damnation
