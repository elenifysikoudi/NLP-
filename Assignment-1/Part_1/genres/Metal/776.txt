Nights I spend awake Waiting for the sign Days never ended When will the time arrive Far beyond my sight Hiding in the dark A semblance of a feeling that was lost But now is found As I take a look around me Never did I feel so lonely In the dream The voice had told me Now it's time For A Different Story Ever will I know What lies inside my mind Searching through my pride I find no place to hide Blindly still I go And leave the past behind Faithfully embrace the light As I take a look around me Never did I feel so lonely In the dream The voice had told me Now it's time For A Different Story
