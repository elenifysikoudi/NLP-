Oh So where's the one You've been speaking of Is he hiding somewhere Or just inside your head You built this prison by yourself I can see You're falling in front of me And don't make it so easy I can see You're not getting anywhere So pretend this was never yours You suffer you suffer Just like I saw Don't tell me don't tell me Where we go from here Waiting for your final answer Just give it up Just letting know Just letting know You built this prison by yourself I can see You're falling in front of me And don't make it so easy I can see You're not getting anywhere So pretend this was never yours I can see You're falling in front of me And you're making it easy You built this prison by yourself Dug this grave with your own hands Pretend this was never yours I love it when you lose yourself It makes it easy to forget you Pretend this was never yours I can see You're falling in front of me And don't make it so easy I can see You're not getting anywhere So pretend this was never yours I can see You're falling in front of me And you're making it easy And you're not getting anywhere And you're not getting anywhere with me
