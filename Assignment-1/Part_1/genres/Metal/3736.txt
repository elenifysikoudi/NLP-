Twice before you've heard the fury forever more Twice before you felt and learned the power of the storm I brought you through the valley where kings are laid to rest Told you of the tales where hearts were weighed to pass a test Now the third story unfolds and intrigues your every sense No tale will remain untold and we'll speak without penance through the caverns of a deep labyrinth Man was known to well and then led to his death This time through there is no calm before the rage begins This time through the crown that's worn is fit for only kings The chambers are still damp and cold and wait to take your soul The armies of the virtuous are over a hundred fold Feel the fire raging higher of a scorching dragons breath Or gaze into a cauldron black and wait for all the rest I wait in the golden halls I take at will from those who fall I make the dreams that you dream I forsake ones that only scream I wait in the golden halls I take at will from those who fall I make the dreams that you dream I forsake ones that only scream Northern Lights Chaos will be known and will be shown upon this offering You will feel the wrath and linger on as your entering Into the mayhemic ways to be known as the lights Hold on to your fabled reality there is no end in sight
