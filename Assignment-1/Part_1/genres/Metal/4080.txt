"""Paint me as a dead soul The flesh the image the reflection Let's complete the illusion"" There is a flame untamed Deep in my heart Unyielding pure Ain Soph 'tis measureless Our right divine Aspire to all horizons To seek nature ov things Retreat within yourself To find the primal breath Slaves ov the dead gods Martyrs ov the falsehood Your life is death now Engulfed by the wake ov a million years Welcome to Amenti To perceive means to know To possess means to deny In the catacombs ov life Concealed within deaths vaults Pure vibration lies Nitya samsarins Travel to the house ov empty words Am Heh devour their hearts Slaves ov the dead gods Martyrs ov the falsehood Your life is death now Engulfed by the wake ov a million years Welcome to Amenti Jerusalem is falling Falling falling Jerusalem is falling Yerushalaim nehereset "
