"Honor me Chaldean priests Bow to me in adoration Evangelize Prophets of the boundless joy Sanctify the sin of indulgence We worship the sun We worship the moon Spreading like rats Exalted above the stars of god All hail slain and risen god All hail Dionysus ""Come blessed Dionysius various nam'd bull fac'd Begot from Thunder Bacchus fam'd Bassarian God of universal might Whom swords and blood and sacred rage delight"" War be sustained My godless phoenix rise Ne'er to lifeless shall I submit Offering solely the sword not peace Mercy and cowardice extinct within We worship the sun We worship the moon Spreading like rats Exalted above the stars of god All hail slain and risen god All hail Dionysus "
