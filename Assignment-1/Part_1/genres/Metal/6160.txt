The bellows breath Fueling the fire of wrath Spoken in a tongue only embraced by cast out Gods Thrown from the heavens like discharged light A thousand year exile beneath this sulfur cage Prying open the cranial vault for this source of passage Utter the incantations of this vile onslaught Spinning webs up to the stars for insurrection Inviting this disaster to the gardens of Eden Sink these teeth of blasphemy into the skin of faith As weakness devours this broken intellect White eyes grasp white fires and the black shadow of death Reborn through frenzied tasks to sacrifice the hung words of Judas Upon a throne of suffering with visions of hateful awakening Permit these words of hell to be written among the upper regions Lies Lies Swallowing the poison in which to despise Journey through this mental torture Filled with hate in veins of this desire Rise Rise Through this inquisition of the storm of bane Sorcery of intellect to enslave these virgin minds These Godless wounds shall bring the skies below the earth Reaching forth from the judgment in his wicked defiance In legions I am the words of spite and hate In legions I am the wars of wrath Tranquil curses in winded swears These solid wishes of creations end Forewarn in anthem of whispered deaths Transcendence defines this sadistic life In rage I become the virus revenge is what is to be bled Exhibit of morbid reactions that pave roads With the slain remains of the dead Resurface the bones from these mental Chambers of this secret abyss Heaving the words that will open The gates of this vengeance
