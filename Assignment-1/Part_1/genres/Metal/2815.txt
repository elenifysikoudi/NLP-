Fallen blind to the demons within The path to take and I walk it in pain A darkened mind of destructive taste My hateful seed grows stronger within My own hatred it burns deep inside My eyes are blind to the demons within My own hatred I scream inside My lips are sealed by the kiss of non divine My pain is drowning in the tears I cannot shed As flowers withers life must come to an end Can't put me out of my own misery So I continue on my darkened trail of tears My own hatred my trail of tears My pain is drowning in the tears I cannot shed My own journey I'll walk to the end As flowers withers every man has his trails My own hatred my trail of tears My eyes are blind to the demons inside My own hatred it grows inside I hide my fear in the mists of slumbering wine My constant presence will torment my soul Like claws from the past in my eyes shredding tears Can't put me out of my own misery So I walk forever on my darkened trail of tears
