Wolves eat sheep tasting fear in their meant Sheep like you always stare at defeat You seattered and left me alone face to face With the wolf at the door armed with nothing but faith You expect everyone to be weak Weak just like you and to fall at their knees Allowing themselves to just be devoured I wonder if wolves like the taste of a coward like you You stole the rest of the world from me You held me to ransom with my own belifs Blackmailer The architect of my own living death Overseer of a slow and a bitter decay Rotten inside but I just did not see Until the day when you blackmailed me You stole the rest of the world from me You held me to ransom with my own beliefs Blackmailer
