"Leviathan Eternally Thy powers rage within I am reborn Purified In the burning flames ov Sodom By the powers ov the gods Awaken the mighty Will That shalt carry me through eternities Faceless One Avenge my torment Materialize my utmost Will Beyond all legends and myths Thou art the emissary ov the beast Thwart the realm above Spawning might below ""Give us the flesh"" ""Give us the will"" I command Dumuzi Lord Godhead immaculate Thou art the sun Toward the light feel no shame Ia Asag Forever Thou shalt remain In victory I burn Masacrate the enemy In battle that I hath already won Thee I invoke Brothers ov Ariman's seed Thou hast aroused all beings in me Come All in One Resurrected Stronger than death Thou hast become Revert my death Hail to my return Tis time to reign as a god among man ""Give us the flesh"" ""Give us the will"" I command Dumuzi Lord Godhead immaculate Thou art the sun Toward the light feel no shame Ia Asag Forever Thou shalt remain Appolyon O resplendant flame Begotten ov beyond May I coruscate eternally Gods ov all perfection I command come forth In company ov you're All doubts and fears eclipsed"
