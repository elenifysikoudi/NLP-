Falling from the sky now a sign of the burning sun Into the face of the evil one Nowhere to hide now we're on the run right before your eyes We're watching we're waiting our souls are forsaking The sign of the warriors where we will arise Through the fire and the flames breaking the chains Into the night we go Time to pay time of the slain Such as the death we know Our steel will shine forever through the dark and falling rain We'll see them face their fears it's time to rise again in everlasting pain Fly free for what we believe One thousands hearts bleeding the eternal dream Feel me the judgement of me So silently now they will heal cry for eternity See now the fallen are new again We feel the pain burn inside their head Remember now what to be again deep down inside Still cursing still crawling we're endlessly falling The downfall of mankind the fate of the sun Hold your head to the sky bleeding we cry Screaming into the night Fire and pain beginning again Onwards to help me now Stand strong we'll live forever Raging through the barren lands Our eyes have seen the sorrow Far across the stars the power in our hearts Fly far away to the end of our days The voices of long distant cries Now we remain in this labyrinth of pain And so we ride into the night Cry for eternity
