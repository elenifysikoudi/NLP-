Cold breeze blows in a misty grove Making dying leaves fall on the forgotten one Sleeping in a frost covered ground Waiting for someone to find his lonely grave And so did winter come over the grove With beautiful pure white snow Covering all tracks of struggle and fight Of an ending life On a grove sleeping Silently sighing Lonely forgotten this wandering soul Coldness is creeping Only one sleeping In the grove covered with cold winter snow Northern winter in darkness and cold Makes the icy tears spring in his lonely soul Sitting next to his own frozen corpse He wishes he could rest and haunt no more After the winter came a blooming spring White wood anemones within Where his body rested flowers turned red As if marking his bloodstained bed On a grove sleeping Silently sighing Lonely forgotten this wandering soul Coldness is creeping Only one sleeping In the grove covered with cold winter snow On a grove sleeping Silently sighing Lonely forgotten this wandering soul Coldness is creeping Only one sleeping In the grove covered with cold winter snow
