A greater darkness my mind's possessed Disillusioned numb emptiness No hope I feel a paralyzing fear No salvation faking control Their coldness hurt me beyond belief Dominus beo spiritus Will I burn will I be free The great darkness consumed my soul Diabolus libero spiritus Blind my eyes I hate the light Despair frustration regret Fighting fighting for what Lies your lies I feel dead inside My pain is all I leave behind Dominus beo spiritus Will I burn will I be free The great darkness consumed my soul Diabolus libero spiritus A shadow the only light I followed Transparent I am like like a ghost A far cry from whom I wanted to be I never found my place my place nor peace Dominus beo spiritus Will I burn will I be free The great darkness consumed my soul Diabolus libero spiritus
