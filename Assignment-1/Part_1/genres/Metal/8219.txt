A strange cosmic gathering of leading forces The ones that procreated this war within A saga of crushing emotions Bonded and melted by the eyes of the lost years The cursed root of my damnation May my destiny be the one i've created The real motive to continue this battle Rest will never be found until the other face of the infraworld has been conquered Endless voyage full of hate Infinite road covered with pain This gift of fury the awakening of the beast within Honour and blood no failure will be done The fortress deceptive mind of a saddened spirit Claim the scythe my sceptre of frozen grief For this is a neverending tale of scorn But with every soul I have devoured The vengeance just fades closer Near the revelating storm
