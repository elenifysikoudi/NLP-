"Now I'm defeated Brake are my wings Kneeled is my soul I cry tears of blood Close in cosmic void I can feel my hate grow Down in fire and ice Only up again I will fly so higher 'till touch the stars Wounded is my body Scar is my soul But stronger is my spirit I will rise again I'll gaze into space now 'till take the stars The Almighty has broken our wings And destroyed our shields But we are not completely defeat We'll rise shoulder swords against his angel And will have our Kingdom in the Heaven And our freedom as the stars in sky Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven"" In Cosmic Void I lie"" I'll have my vengeance I'll defeat God I'll will rise up on His Throne And I'll hold His old Kingdom As Demon in Hell and Angel in Heaven I'll hold my reign in peace or blood Fight for me brothers together we will win A new order will come With our victory Total war for reign Total war for peace Down in fire I descend And up in sky I take my soul My spirit fly over snow covered plain And on shining landscape Is the time for all mankind to rise and fight this war"" But my soul is tremble In front of might of God Weak appear my spirit Beneath Universal Force I won't fall in darkness But never I'll may win I cuoldn't surrender And so I have fought"" Close in cosmic void I can feel my hate grow Down in fire and ice Only up again I will fly so higher 'till touch the stars Wounded is my body Scar is my soul But stronger is my spirit I will rise again I'll gaze into space now 'till take the stars I must fight against His sons And I had to fall war will be done Sacrifice my soul to evil forces Take their powers We'll become stronger We'll destroy our enemies We'll make a desert called peace Our swords will call their names This will be our Hell"""
