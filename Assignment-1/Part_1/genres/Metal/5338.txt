Proud and so glorious standing before of us Our swords will shine bright in the sky When united we come to the land of the sun With the heart of a dragon we ride We are flying on wings in winter sky With fire burning deep inside We are warriors of endless time forever and on On wings of steel an ancient flight We see the powers that unite The gods will now send us a sign of battles once more Through the valley we ride full of glory we soar Where the fights will be raging for now and for more When united we come and divided they fall Tonight you will witness it all Proud and so glorious standing before of us Our swords will shine bright in the sky When united we come to the land of the sun With the heart of a dragon we ride A land unknown we come so far We ride the night till morning star When colours fade to black and white Your eyes come to sight With the vision of a great divide You turn towards the other side You think you run but you can't hide The dead can not ride Through the valley we ride full of glory we soar Where the fights will be raging for now and for more When united we come and divided they fall Tonight you will witness it all Proud and so glorious standing before of us Our swords will shine bright in the sky When united we come to the land of the sun With the heart of a dragon we ride Over high seas and mountains We fly to the heavens On wings of a dragon tonight Proud and so glorious standing before of us Our swords will shine bright in the sky Proud and so glorious standing before of us Our swords will shine bright in the sky When united we come to the land of the sun With the heart of a dragon The heart of a dragon The heart of a dragon we ride
