Long have I waited and long have I lain here alone Cold and starving in the dark Moment by moment I am drifting closer To the land of the dead An incessant noise echoes in my skull It twines and vibrates down my spine Fanning out to the raw endings of my nerves The noise grows louder its source looming closer in a tightening spiral The center can not hold things fall apart It takes all the strength I have just to open my eyes Is this really what dying feels like Ritual begins when the moon are at crest And I call for the ancients to guide me through the gates The silver moon white blade so cold against my skin And the warm crimson blood glistening in the dark I am sealed in my own tomb After nine days of fast The ritual will begins long and painful it will be And most likely I will not come out alive But I made up my mind There is no turning back now The utter destruction of light The end of my life Ritual begins when the moon are at crest And I call for the ancients to guide me through the gates The silver moon white blade so cold against my skin And the warm crimson blood glistening in the dark I have formed my intensions The shadows gather thickening the air I submit myself to the darkness And I throw myself into the abyss Ritual begins Is this really what dying feels like Ritual begins when the moon are at crest And I call for the ancients to guide me through the gates The silver moon white blade so cold against my skin And the warm crimson blood glistening in the dark I have formed my intensions The shadows gather thickening the air I submit myself to the darkness And I throw myself into the abyss I offer thee my flesh and blood Guide me through the gates Grant to me eternal life The ultimate sacrifice
