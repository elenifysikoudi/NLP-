now now now now i'm looking back fear of life in my head I grow lost it all dreams they wait now now now now I can't crasp it the tears will try try to hide to help me away away away now you're so far away so far away can I have confidence in love all I gave is not enough the hour feel the time no hope now I'm still alive now now now all is drifting away tears will try try to hide to help me by myside away away away now you're so far away so far away now I've doubts if the needs for safety emotions fly pay living them is not enough be hidden feelings shown reserved trust eat them use of confidence
