"Welcome to Theatre of Absurd When the world and reason are the audience And actor illusion and experience only Here gleams shiny mandala In the chamber of creation and annihilation And Lingam links with Yoni wisdom stone make There is neither space nor time Books are read backwards or from all side Everything will sink and tear down phantom of mourning Picture of universe in this simple formula ""Love is the Law"" Proverb of juggler on the gate engraved That life is delight That death is also life"
