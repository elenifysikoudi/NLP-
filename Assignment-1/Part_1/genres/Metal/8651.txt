How many shadows on the path of each man how many shadows will be added a host of voices that will suffocate the silence of solitude an explosion of colours will represent their emotions on the road of life reflections of billions of stars that will shine while we pass but the shadow eyes lord thros salt on my injuries and while the blood runs slow in my veins the nightmare swallows me you can decide to stand to spin the wheel of destiny just live who will stop the race there is space for the good and the veil who will stop the race you can decide to stand you can decide to stand who will stop the race
