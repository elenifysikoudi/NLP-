Embraced by darkness I am lost in a silent void Lying on a cold grave Once mourned now forgotten Since the day I passed the cemetary portals I dwell in a dark emptiness Year after hour my veins turn to dust In a time endless I see myselft wither away Wither away Abandoned in the silent grave I dwell Staring into darkness with lifeless eyes If no one hears my silent cries forgotten and vanished I shall always be Forlorn of hope chained to solitariness With despair in my soul I'm wrapped into obscurity Satan The horned emperor of depths Lend to me dark demon wings Grant me the strength for my journey Enshrined in the dark in a cold black casket Cursed to live in this grim immortal existence Father show mercy upon my tormented soul Reveal the darkened path to the realms of hell Realms of hell Abandoned in the silent grave I dwell Staring into darkness with lifeless eyes Lord why have you abandoned me Why have you ignored my prayers
