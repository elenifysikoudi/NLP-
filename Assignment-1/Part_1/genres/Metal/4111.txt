Music by Nergal lyrics by Tomas Krajewski Night in the mountains comes with the fly of a raven Carpathians bathed in the light of the moon In old ruins where the dying shadows Are watching the shine from the stars Nobody remembers days of glory Several hundreds years passed in silence Not a soul has been seen here I am standing on a hill So silent is the sky I am drinking the cold of this night Old grey wolf lying upon my feet Is licking the hand of mine It is night in my heart It is moon in my eyes I am hidden in a fog my own breath Small village in a valley Sleeping in a fear in a fear of me Loathsome race of the mortals magic of wolfish teethes wings of bats Faithful guards of religion Old as the blood itself The cult of the undead Vampirism Frenzy of lust frenzy of pain She was only fourteen No cry has burst from her lips Pity that she had to die but how sweet was her neck It is night in my heart It is moon in my eyes I am hidden in a fog My own breath Sometimes only my anthem of triumph Echoes in mountains landscape Like blood from thorn opened arteries Poison flows down the tongue Somewhere far away a howling can be heard Oh how beautiful is the night in Transylvania Frenzy of lust frenzy of pain Blood is life ETERNAL
