Multiplying existence of the wretched human beings A pain stricken legacy of greed the wealthy Few leaving only scrapes for us behind While the rest of the fucking world breeds just to survive A greedy minority facilities our demise As we all turn our backs on the power we hold inside There shall be no end to this pathetic reign of terror cast Upon this planet until the day comes that we all Verge of death we close our eyes our time is Fucking ending our natural instinct is a lust for greed Killing each other unknowingly tell me what is left when Greed has bled us bare ignorant populations are Fucking nations are destruction of The entire human race stuck on earth to suffocate Are we all doomed to this fate buried Beneath a sea of the spreading disease The earth lies victim to the wrath ignorance Their heads children here to support The poor when they are weak and old Our problem lies deep for some We can not reverse what's done A scarce future lies ahead If we don't think we'll all be dead Multiplying endlessly All to soon no room to breathe
