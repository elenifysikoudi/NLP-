This touch of a lasting life Awaits an impiety of pain A life taken into its own hands Falls on countless journeys Can you feel the fallen ages This timeless slumber from cold These frail fingers to untouch a life This new mold At long lasting emptiness In sunken warmth Fused into one being For all eternity Tasting a bitter delight For this last transgression of praise The winds are blown from an opposite plane To conjure the eternal flame As I drown in the poisoned river Breathing a last breath in escape Visualize a lost approach To the beginning of a new man This kiss of the accursed On virgin lips The dirty angel Of all utmost sympathy praised Smoldering in forgotten A cursed stone thrown At those awaiting this judgment View and isolate Its unwanted display of power Swallowing these sin submerged cities With oceans of fire To escape in legend Will be unforgiven by all of man Engravings of a sunken race to return to land Uncovered city beneath the sands Mighty fortresses covering the plains of crossroads A smell of screams burn through the air Grains of salt covering these grains of sand Sharp were the thorns of this false kings fall As I stand upon the mountain Staring into the blackness Seize of darkness seize of hatred Seize of evil I fear not for my life For I am one with death A passage through sorrow To taste winters breath All the false images that lead the youth to damnation These lost years have been written by an ancient divine will Misfortunes of the world a trait to be engulfed with sin Holding the hands of unvirtue Entwined blackness burns a creation to ash An ungodliness that devours itself whole Manifest this chaos of the arts Terror in the minds eye A sick sea where brothers slay brothers Stare within this foretold divine decree
