Even if the sun refused to shine Even if we lived in different time Even if the ocean left the sea There would still be you and me Ever since the start of time You've had my love Even before I knew your name I knew your heart In the dark of the darkest night I could see your face I always knew from the very start I would find a way Even if the sun refused to shine Even if we lived in different time Even if the ocean left the sea There would still be you and me Even if the world would disappear Even if the clouds would shed no tears Even if tonight was just a dream There would still be you and me You've always been and you always will be The only one Until forever The only girl Until forever I'll ever love In the cold of winter's chill I'll be there to warm your heart Giving you all of me For all time No matter what Two hearts that belong together Together From the very start One love Now and forever Now and forever Nothing can tear up apart
