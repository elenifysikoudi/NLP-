Darkness fell on winter skies Daylight died as the fullmoon rose Winds were cold and the trees were bare The shadows danced on the mirrormere Days were night when the sun had failed The silence ruled no sound appeared Freezing moon shined everywhere I felt so cold the end was near Everlasting winter frostwinds rode the skies Neverending darkness until fire walks the earth Cold winds of darkness give me shelter from daylight Winter embrace me and hide me from morning
