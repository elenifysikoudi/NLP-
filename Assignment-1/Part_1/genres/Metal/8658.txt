Keep yourself alive take all your time and you will survive mindless you say but it's your life insane you lie to me bllody days float around my suppliant broken heat you've disappeared Oh I beg you stay But maybe what I need is inside of me you lie lie lies inside of me from my eyes you wish to fade you wish to fade my friend my love in this night run away run away from me hear me now it's sad but I feel your liar heart your liar heart
