As the night opens I see your face in the shadow of the moon I see your glimmering eyes reflected by the glittering snow Frozen winds whines over the silent landscape The only sound I hear are the strokes of your wings Ravenna strigoi mortii Oh countess in black you who rides on stormy winds Primeval goddess who's name is spoken with fear Thunder roar lighting strikes Unlock your demon gate Come forth the serpent's queen Torture be thy name I give to you this sacrifice take this child Lend me one of your serpent eyes to see beyond the demon gates I invoke the flying goddess come out from the gorge of night Spread your darkened wings and soar above the ground Ravenna strigoi mortii Cast thy shadow over earth in answer of my calls
