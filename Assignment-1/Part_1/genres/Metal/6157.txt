Understood in the start of all endings I've wandered so far from this discipline Unease begins this climb to stellar thoughts Causing this descent into cavernous neglect Carving these Egyptians into flesh for this damned access into the void A white haze covers this perception release me into the layers of this demise Open these channels of this self murder The wish to deny the golden flight of skies Transcend into breathless expiration upon the layers of this earthly prison Prying apart the skeleton that is the cage to the soul Awaken from death as cage with teeth Wreckage of emotion crumbled in this hateful Obsession before this kiss of decay Reborn without an emotional bond To be cast into a depth of souls Satisfied as I feed in cultural habit Upon the buried trance of a savior Unseeing I fall into starless rituals In this defiance the decay is born Growling hunger of eternal rest Spreading like a virus of ravenous wolves Absolute in confines of breathless domains Peeling off this skin to shed this essence of shame Exposing the truths behind this eminent return That has been bred in burning earth Without worth I climb Lost to this darkness emerging from black Hallowing these souls that have defied this cryptic heart of wrath All will be burnt All will be lost As this veil of blood will pour from the skies Washed of all that is pure Be the tool that defiles That carves the awareness from fragile minds Burn out the sky Black out my eyes Unwrought vision for this sick design Destroyed the emotion of the heart to Conquer this place of death
