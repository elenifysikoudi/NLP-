Life's uncertain a rat race of pain Endlessly searching for more Hopeless and needless held back the chains 'Till we can't take anymore Hold on Stay strong Breaking out from the past life fading No more what for All we got is to keep on praying Pray for the done for the lives in dismay Witness the final decay Suffering in silence for years we were blind But now we git something to say Hold on stay strong 'Till the end a fate of dying No more what for Nothing left but to keep on fighting United incited not misguided We'll fight through time before our one true destiny Benighted ignited still strong and undivided This day foretold now here for all to see So free in the blue skies with time marches on Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold Strangers in a strange world defenders through time Cursed in our kingdom of unholy fire Legends of darkness will be on the grave Spill their blood under the sun Voices are calling with anger and rage The final war now has begun Hold on stay strong 'Till the end a fate of dying No more what for Nothing left but to keep on fighting United incited not misguided We'll fight through time before our one true destiny Benighted ignited still strong and undivided This day foretold now here for all to see So free in the blue skies with time marches on Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold Strangers in a strange world defenders through time Cursed in our kingdom of unholy fire Hear our call save us all Standing tall tonight The flame will slowly fade away The shadows of our lives Will ash away the memories Before the last sunrise We'll keep holding on In the sands of changes Standing strong against the winds Until the end of time Hold on stay strong 'Till the end not afraid of dying No more what for Nothing left but to keep on fighting United incited not misguided We'll fight through time before our one true destiny Benighted ignited still strong and undivided This day foretold now here for all to see So free in the blue skies with time marches on Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold Strangers in a strange world defenders through time Cursed in our kingdom of unholy fire Hear our call save us all Standing tall tonight Hear our call save us all Standing tall tonight
