Grant me profane kiss oh Isis mother of all Thy lips like morphine teasing my slumbering heart Release me this cosmos is way too small Come down on earth evangelize Ravishing muse abduct my spirit And bury my will in spacious beyond That human thought can never reach Alight upon the earth and consecrate my engines of life And so I chant that triumph of might Trampling kingdoms of conscience I the archangel of wrath with one word the unholy sword I overmastered every image of god I come in splendor and golden glory Seeking war trophies and sacred spoils To purify this heart of mine to cast away rotten rood Defile morality of the blind god
