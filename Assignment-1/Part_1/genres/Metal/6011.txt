Now you see me getting better I'm right here on this play And I'll make it a bit heavier By going all the way Did you find it much easier To stoop to where I was With your power And your knowledge To leave me here Alone alone I'm all alone Alone alone I'm all alone Now's the time For being humble By holding you Down on your knees
