FOOLS I cast you all aside Your bullets harm me not I am heresy blazing hell The embodiment ov all you fear I am all which you can never be A truth revealing hate machine No longer will I tolerate Lies from a kingdom built on dread Yet what if naught exists above No shining glory and no god You question not blindly believe Upon your ignorance I shall feast Damn higher virtues divine love Your wooden idols and your law Kneel before your god yet do not see He doth feel you lies Blinds you with fear Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth Your hearts I shall tear With paws ov truth With slashing jaws I rape Your feeble womb No god exists to save you from thy doom You will never see the light Bound to always live by lies
