Silent screams and shattered dreams awash with this insanity Still lost within the misery and pain that lies inside Here alone the fight to breathe still searching for the truth to be Blackened by the burning fire held deep inside my mind Far beyond the lost horizon standing on the shore Across the seas their hearts will bleed There's laughter waiting for Taste the steel in pain we live For glory we defend Their fallen souls will rise to fight again Stand here with me this night we'll be together Future in our hands we'll fight with freedom glowing here Stand here with me for we will live forever Tonight we'll stand and face it all Falling rain will hide the pain that lies beneath the burning flames All hope is gone so carry on before the world will fall Rise again to die in vain now life can never be the same Our own salvation drawing near I hear the darkness call Skies are falling thunderstorm and stand before the world We're banished now to barren wastelands fight the demon oh Riding on through black and darkness cross the endless sands We sail away our victory at hand Stand here with me Together we'll be stronger Side by side we conquer lands And storm across the seas Die here with me We feel this pain no longer For now and never we will live In my heart in my soul I am out of control Fly across the mountains and towards the distant sun Tears evermore we cry like before Feel the breakdown of my body just set me free Feel the breakdown of my body Just come and set me free
