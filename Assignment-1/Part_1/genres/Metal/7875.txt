This is my realm here I am king A kingdom of hatred where tormented souls sing Here I am pain here I am death Here I'm the hand that will take your last breath Your last breath You used to feed me with your fucking lies Always you faced me with your big fake smile You must be stupid if you thought you're safe Next time you'll see me you will feel my hate I am the bullet that will claim your soul Here I'm the fire that burns you to coal I am the blade that will cut you deep There will be no mercy if we ever meet You used to feed me with your great lies Always you faced me with your fucking smile You must be stupid if you thought you're safe Next time we'll meet you will feel my hate Now here before me you tremble in fear Pathetic excuses are all that I hear We are the ones who will end this strife Now when you're facing the demons of five Demons of five Demons of five
