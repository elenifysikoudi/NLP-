WAVES DON'T MAKE ME DROWN sometimes there is no sleep awake i lie in bed and the journey begins again again again WAVES DON'T MAKE ME DROWN i'm living through all i ever felt the pictures in my head the words so loud i have no reflect if i want it or not my burnt out soul sends me a sign LAST S O S LAST S O S not willing to fail giving up my mind i fight against the dawn i'll save my live the stormy sea is full of waves those ups and downs try to weaken me WAVES DON'T MAKE ME DROWN WAVES DON'T MAKE ME DROWN not willing to fail giving up my mind DROWN WAVES DON'T MAKE ME DROWN WAVES DON'T MAKE ME DROWN WAVES DON'T MAKE ME DROWN WAVES DON'T MAKE ME DROWN DROWN WAVES DON'T MAKE ME DROWN DROWN WAVES DON'T MAKE ME DROWN DROWN WAVES DON'T MAKE ME DROWN
