"Another night Another inner fight The demons calling My soul is dark But with a touch of light The whole world's changing I draw the line My pleasure redefined It's now awakening I feel the urge Emotions on the verge AND NOW ITS TIME TO KILL KILL KILL KILL The speed of light I feel the time is right I've smashed all boundaries My skull is crushed Adrenaline is rushed THE NIGHT HAS FOUND ME Infection spread A spirit through my head THE TIME IS COMING I know the score But I gotta have have em all AND ALL MORE I COULD KILL KILL KILL KILL I am what I choose to be I lose grip of reality And I have nothing to atone All your morals formed in vein And now my pleasure is my pain BUT I'M GONNA MAKE IT ALL MY OWN own own The sun is up But I can't get enough THE SKIES THE LIMIT I'm on the top But I ain't gonna stop ILL NEVER GIVE IN It's in my brain It's driving me insane HALLUCINATIONS ""Always the same"" But I ain't gonna save DESTRUCTION I MUST KILL KILL KILL KILL I am what I choose to be I lose grip of reality And I have nothing to atone All your morals formed in vein And now my pleasure is my pain BUT I'M GONNA MAKE IT ALL MY OWN own own I've seen the sun rise once again I've lived my life and now I'm dead Time to come down all on my own own This is nothing new for me This is my reality SO OPEN YOUR EYES AND DON'T EVER HIDE AWAY I am what I choose to be I lose grip of reality And I have nothing to atone All your morals formed in vein And now my pleasure is my pain BUT I'M GONNA MAKE IT ALL MY OWN own own OUT HERE ON MY OWN"
