Great Spirits hear me We are hopeless can't you see There must be one key You have to set us free Now I see a bright light in the sky Great Spirits they fly Spirits know what to do You gave us the sky so blue The light turns to fire Great Spirits come closer Spirits in the sky Among the flames they fly Fire burning high Voices on our mind We'll create you a sword from the stones And the shield that protects you We'll give you the courage to fight It's all we can do to help Now to Graynell you go Breton's warriors will help you From Sendell you find Cruelty of the darkest mind You must fight for our freedom You have to kill Delinom With my troops I'll ride To Sendell this sword by my side I know that the Spirits are near In my mind I won't feel the fear Spirits in the sky Among the flames they fly Fire burning high Voices in my mind We'll create you a sword from the stones And the shield that protects you We'll give you the courage to fight It's all we can do to help I have to survive
