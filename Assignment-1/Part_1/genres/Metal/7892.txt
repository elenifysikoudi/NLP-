Demons At night they call my name Visions Of my journey through the flames Blackened eyes Watching in the fire Horned one Awaits my soul in hell Descended to the abyss On a lifeless shore Enshrouded in obscurity The kingdom called my name I saw the shadowed portals Open before my eyes Far away I saw the light I entered through the chambers In which the fire burns The cries of damned souls Echoed through the abyss I gazed into the flames Burning oh so bright I threw myself into the deeps Satan Into the flames I fall Eternally I burn In the hellish deeps Satan Hell awaits my soul Eternally I burn Into the fire eternal Dreamlike visions Of a journey into hell I burned for master satan I burned for his throne I heard the mournful voices Of a thousand souls Burning for eternity I entered through the chambers In which the fire burns The cries of damned souls Echoed through the abyss I gazed into the flames Burning oh so bright I threw myself into the deeps
