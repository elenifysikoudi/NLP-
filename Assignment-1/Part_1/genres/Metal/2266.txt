If you're hurt by someone Hold out the other cheek This is the most important message That someone left to humanity Then you came with your holy book Then you spread this holy gift Bible in one hand a sword in the other To slay all people thinking different Holy man I reny your church Too many slaughters've been done Holy man I won't pray for your god For he let you kill in his name Remember this innocent people Devoured by flames for being different In these dark times of heresy When devil was every woman Remember this dirty unbelievers They died by their brothers swords Covered with crusades blood Murdered for the holy cause Holy man I reny your church Too many slaughters've been done Holy man I won't pray for your god For he let you kill in his name Hypocrit priest of hate You forgot what you exist for In your mouth love means death for anyone But the sheep that follows your insane path Let us think by ourselves We don't need your misleading talk Let us remember what love means Centuries of lies made us forget Holy man I reny your church Too many slaughters've been done Holy man I won't pray for your god For he let you kill in his name
