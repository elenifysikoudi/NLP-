Lost long ago through the ages of time Once ruled immortal the guardians of light Bonded together they stood side by side Storm winds brought darkness the world in decline Quest for their hammers to reclaim the throne Three brought together by warriors unknown United to vanquish all hell from the earth Conquering glory the kingdom's rebirth Raise your swords sound the final war cry Stand fight fight for your lives Thousands will die but their deaths not in vain Now reunited our world may be free once again Three hammers high in the burning red sky Forged in the fire protectors of mankind Three hammers high for the world we unite Fight for our lives as we hold up the three hammers high Long have we travelled through forgotten lands From coldest valleys to burning red sands Restless we ride through the depths of all hell Triumph and agony death will prevail Raise your swords sound the final war cry Stand fight fight for your lives Strike back with vengeance til death we defend Until the day that the dragons will rise once again Three hammers high in the burning red sky Forged in the fire protectors of mankind Three hammers high for the world we unite Fight for our lives as we hold up the three hammers high Strike down the unbelievers March on for justice we now stand Once more the path for glory Take back the power in our hands Long years of terror and the long years of pain Still marching onwards til victory's ours once again Victory's ours once again Three hammers high in the burning red sky Forged in the fire protectors of mankind Three hammers high for the world we unite Fight for our lives as we hold up the three hammers high
