New page They say it's a new way Won't change Rules are all the same Control Freedom is a symbol New fight Let's get ready to rumble I don't want the same shit Without soul I don't want the same shit Under control I don't want the same shit Without brain I don't want the same shit and feel the same pain Masses You can be used without a face Fuck this Don't be a member of the race Real life You are all alone Stand up Nothing counts but your own
