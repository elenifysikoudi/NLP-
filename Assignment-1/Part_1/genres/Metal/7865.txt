Satan angel of darkness carry me Through the seventh gate Take me to the regions of evil let your Flames surround my soul I have given you my mortal life I wear Your marks with pride You were the razor in my flesh now take My blackened soul Enrich me with the powers of evil Let me stand by your throne Let me become a soldier of darkness For you I'll raise my sword In my heart your black flame burns My eyes are cold as death my blood is rivers of hate I am the very essence of evil Evil Your wings will carry me through the darkened skies Far beyond the realms where light no more shines My eyes reflect your flame Forever I will remain
