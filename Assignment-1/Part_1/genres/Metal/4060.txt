Why are you here You should be leading Elger my brother dear Don't you remember me I'm the one who raised that riot caused fear Memories in my head Now I remember what you did soon you're dead My wife died that day Elger's people kept that secret so I would stayed Ice earth wind and fire I possess them now with might and glory Powers in my heart now I am the god And all you will worship me Now prepare to die My sword pierces your heart revenge is now mine Now you burn in hell Reigning the elements you will rise and fell Ice earth wind and fire You have lost them now I feel my glory Peace enters this land It came by my hand With the power of sword it is done Ice earth wind and fire You have lost them now I feel my glory Peace enters this land It came by my hand With the power of sword it is done
