After days filled with darkness Comes a dawn the last in time It shall burn the wings of angels And desecrate the heart of man It will flood the shores of heaven And unleash the wrath of flames It will tear your god's creation And caress the soil with grief I turn and face the dawn In a time of damnation Stars are fading its the end of creations Greet the dawn one last time No more sorrow as all life ends Dawn of fire wrath of flames Join the ashes as damnation begins Greet the dawn as you die No more sorrow it's the dawn of the dead It's the dawn of flames In a time of tears No more sorrow No more fear No repention no salvation You can't escape the flames of hate Burning your eyes burning your face Licking your skin as the storm begins
