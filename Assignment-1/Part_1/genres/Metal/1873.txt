Yesterday happened something You've never spoken about I thought I'm a part of your world Why did you shut me out Promises full of pleasures Why did you steal the light Let the rain wash away the memories that hurt inside My revenge will take you over Taste my pain First I ran from you Now I slow down You can get me but can't get over me I show you what you've denied
