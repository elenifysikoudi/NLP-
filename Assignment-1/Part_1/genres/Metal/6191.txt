Innocence inscribed in this crudeness of rites Wounds worn by the heretics of light Creation of hell bound life Thrill of this inversion Majesty of leviathan Ambitious within hell Faultered with endless worship of neglect Renounce this life in pain Transform this intense self allegiance with marks of descent Seen through eyes of blasphemy This soul will become one with the blade This wake in testimonial acceptance of life's end I am the doorway that opens unto the path of darkness Drowning skin with ancient beliefs of selfless deceit The hour of death is at hand The sixth lock is opened Engage this justice with streams of lifeless reject This internal embrace within the confines of blood Winds of stench upon this plain of the righteous Whispering into the ears of deaf perversions These chains of the undivine held by the right hand of the devil To achieve this revelation of the self mutilated The day that calls for mercy is denied with scorn of hate Voices fall within the ghost of all memory Engulf this lost soul in downfall of personal faith Attained in violence Eternal Prodigy of the four will be unleashed Through arteries of agony's reign Malevolence is endured within cycles of written resurrection These wounds vomit the vital fluid that will raise the curse of blasphemy The air filled lungs of this offering are inhaled by carrion Extraction in bleeding this loss A scar that remains nameless is forged Nocturnal in binding with this descent Exchanging of fluid with hate These channels of life now fade Dead young from Judea will rise Invoking this crudeness This mark of Lucifer Grasp of achieving This comfort of entrance to hell Seething blade savior In this kiss of failure Sinking below Restraint of dark walls so I am confined
