dancing wish and melting kiss I wrap my fleshless arms around her Come the thaw come within Come my love and melt around me She buried me I dropped my wish And now as love's true ghost lies dying I'll raise my fist and victory Never allow this pain its clutches into me Hollowed dreams hollowed earth crumbling drive We turn around step away and watch it all run down forcibly we make these dreams into something real a shattered cast a blackened mast a hail hung high in waning life dancing wish and melting kiss I wrap my fleshless arms around her kicking dusted dreams into the air I've come I've died I've won come the thaw come within come my love and melt around me Come and seethe come to die just to live it all again
