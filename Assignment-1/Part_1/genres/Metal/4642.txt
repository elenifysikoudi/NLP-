Nothing can numb this pain nothing can fill this void Nothing can heal this wound nothing can hide this scar Nothing is what I have nothing is all that's left Nothing is what I am if I am without you Looking down at my feet why do they move at all Looking down at my hands why do they work at all I hear the words I speak why can I speak at all If I can't speak to you why can I speak at all I won't give up this pain the pain of what I lost I don't want to be healed why do they even try Pain is all I have left to tell me this was real Pain is the only thing left I can feel My scars I show you know my scars They prove my life was real my scars Here on my face here on my arms Lines from a play you were the star You see them now you see my truth The way I lived I lived for you These scars proved my life was real Now you can see my face now you can hear my words Now can you understand how I traced out my world Why must I face this life Why am I here alone Where did the future go Why am I here alone
