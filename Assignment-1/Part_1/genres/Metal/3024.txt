Locked inside of this oppressive life You've surrendered your mind to its conformity You lost all you once had to its fucking lies Bringing those you loved down with you It seemed like an eternity i was lost lost in your lies Striving for a breath of change you would never give Taught to enslave the ones who can't fight your way of life This was not my choice Give me a reason to look back on you And defy my strength Give me a reason not to smash your face in You're worthless in my eyes On my own I don't crave redemption In your fucking lies As you inflicted you could not give me solace You're worthless in my eyes Sever it all from my thoughts the bloodshed the torment Sever the memory Sever it all from my thoughts the horror you gave me Sever the memory I will not fall victim to you again Blinded with the fear searching for a new way To lay the seeds of deceit as you just fucking betray Your actions soaked in blood Just like the doctrine that you preach every day Fuck your indoctrination It destroyed all my hopes for you as i fell away away Mislead and forced to serve for your crooked faith Bitter from your violent ways Anger filled my every day Rejected the notion of a god or a hell Renounced your religion ill rely upon my self Oppression was not the life for me I could never follow blindly So what's left for us Hatred and so much bad blood Leaving me with one choice You must be severed
