We are riding for the battle field in force tonight Fury of the darkest evil cry for war Far beyond the boundaries of hell and starlight On the road to lands unknown forever more Through the caverns far below our quest will lead us Onwards through the ice and snow forever more Standing fighting full of hate the time has come now Stand and sound the guns of glory cry for war On wings of glory we will carry on Far across forgotten lands towards the distant sun And in the darkness shinning far beyond the starlight Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun When the glory of the master's time has come Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens With the power of the universe we stand strong together Trough the forced of power it will soon reach the hour For victory we ride fury of the storm We are the chosen one we can not fail now Spilling all the blood on the fires below Smashing through the boundaries with the fire and fury Killing all the mortals down the winding road Hell fires are raging the storm growing strong On the path to victory towards the distant sun And in the darkness shinning far beyond the starlight Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun When the glory of the master's time has come
