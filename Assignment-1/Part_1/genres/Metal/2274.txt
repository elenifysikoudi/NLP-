Death I'm dying Laying on the bed that will be my last one The faces of my beloved surround me They'll all pass me away I have no fear My time is done and it's time to leave Nothing remains of me But my dying body that lies in this circle of tears My eyes will soon close And my soul will reach its new home The empty shell of my body Will turn into dust and ashes And suddenly it is done I watch my corpse flying upon him I've got nothing to do here for evermore It's time to leave now The Journey I'm dead now Sat in Charon's boat I'm reaching my new home Into the isle of the dead he'll lead me Where I'll rest for the end of times I have no fear The floods are filled with lost souls who'll try to get me But they won't take my spirit Cause I'm already done with life My eyes will soon see The giant trees and the island's hole filled cliffs My ethereal and living soul Will reach its eternal sleep And slowly we cross the lake I watch the shore craving to touch it I'm so tired please let me die It's is time to rest now
