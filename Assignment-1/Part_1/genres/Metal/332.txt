"Rise gods of the fierous black burning skies Raise hammers spears and swords high on your ride Along the great legends born of fire and ice Warriors on horses attack from the mountainous sides Fires shall flame to the skies all battalions stride Alliances stand line by line Hordes of men armoured to die Fight warriors of norse while death glances in your eyes Swing axes and blades unto the final ride Attrition holds forces under the great fires Now heathenous shall be the victors with swords forged by fire A warcry shall echo the rise Loud from the fierce mountainside All set their lives on the line To death which is for you all to sign Ride Under The Fire Under The Great Fires Man Of The Mountains Ride Under The Fire Under The Great Fires No Man Of The Mountains Ride Under The Fire Under The Great Fires Man Of The Mountains Ride Under The Fire Under The Great Fires Man Of The Mountains Ride with the wind in your eyes break through the enemies lines Dark is the power we rise here under the great fires Victory stands on this days bring to all warriors their fate Ride our enemies down bring them all to the ground March under the gods of our fathers unite March under the flag of the norse ""Oden"
