so many days are spent pacing away to me oh it's an accident trivial honesty lay your pulses on the road lay your wisdom on the road split the difference darling stack promises two by two may i keep this thing away from you green the hall my original weekend the order was tall the closets were speaking i bend under the weight of all this fate and paint my face my heart is dead oh split the difference darling stack promises two by two may i keep this thing away from you i feel so jaded i feel so jaded i feel so wasted i'm much older i'm so much older by the way i brought you into this by the way i brought you inside
