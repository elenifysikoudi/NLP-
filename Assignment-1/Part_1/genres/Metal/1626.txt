J Hall What the hell is this I don't know what to do I'm stuck in this position Don't know where to go Caught in the center Caught in between I can't think right A solution cant even be seen You have something to shoot for Something that I don't It's what I want most Get mad No I won't Chorus Who are you to say What I can or cannot do Want you with me one day Next day you don't Chorus
