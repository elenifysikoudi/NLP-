"From beyond all paths of man I drew my rules Infamous among gods and low I did fall And the earth hath cried aloud Hark For enraged winds and storms now awaken Now see me naked yet draped in flames My pent fury to unleash upon men Of chaos I am the disobedient one Depraved son who hath dwelt in nothingness Upon the ninth I fell from grace up above To taste this life of sin to give birth to the ""I"" I didst create demigods strong in will and deed That they may stand proud and call out thy names How dare thou cross the paths of mine And leave my fallen sons behind Oh I shall feast in Gutter as king of nothing I shall feed on thee the Mightiest One Behold For I am Him Life giving flower that belongst to the dawn Hear Feel Pray Kneel"
