25 years of void I've been dead awaiting always with a two faced sky above me Searching for forgotten realms of the sun and loosing the sense of what is an illusion I shall be the Immortal thunder such sights such truths I can't no longer stand My time has come to separate my fear from my flesh As the Eternity opens in blood red aura I feel the nails of Anxiety hammering my soul Behind me I can see my twisted reflections my mortal shell is whithered and dissolved in superior torment I have come one with Suffering As a thousand carcasses are licking my blood tears Filth of aged flesh is falling from the stars this is my punishment my joy Impaled in spikes of sorrow I've vanished then I awake into an obscure dungeon where I awake just to realize that my tragedy of pleasure was just a dream
