Angela Gossow Michael Amott Living in the shadows Crawling in the dark Another face you will never see Another voice you will never hear Erase my mortal shell To feed my dying soul Morbid glory shines on me I will leave my mark You will know When I go You will see Exist to exit Suicide escape oblivion Kiss the blade of sharp cold steel The perfect day for my final exit Hold you breath when I die Art action reincarnation Evolution through ritual death Reborn as an infamous legend Forever immortal post mortem fame Lead melody Michael Amott Lead Christopher Amott Outro Whammy Lead Christopher Amott
