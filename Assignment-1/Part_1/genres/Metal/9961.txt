Like insects of the night we are drawn into the light Feeding off the star glow energ controlling our fate Bloodsucker selling hope to the hopeless Newborn messiah or the devil incarnate Surrounded by a field of lost souls These feeble minds so easy to control Salvation Damnation It's all the same to you But does anyone really know What the future holds in store A day will come When the sun will rise again Rays of black will shine And together as one We will walk in the dark of the sun Say a prayer for the unborn child in the womb The children are the heirs of this dogmatic chaos Is there a future in this claustrophobic tomb We can only rely upon ourselves to save us We are the resistance our last line of defense Prepared to fight for our promised land Rebels at heart they will hunt us to the ends of the earth The chase is on forever going on and on
