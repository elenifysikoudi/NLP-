Can you feel the pain inside sometimes in my mind In the land of loneliness the seas of blood run cold Is the feeling lost inside within the sins of all mankind Time after time we stood united on we go Fly far away don't let the world pass you by Live for the day when we must stand and survive Now we face the judgment day our souls will feel the pain Hear the screams of my world through the rain Silent fields of despair my tears in the rain Pain in my heart bleeding through One day we'll be back for one moment in time Endlessly searching for you Who can cure my emptiness inside for this time Suffering from loneliness my dreams and hopes will die No more feelings left inside my blackened heart I cannot hide Time after time our souls divided on we cry Fly far away don't leave your own past behind Live for the day another year passes by Now we turn to face our fear there's nothing more to say Still your dreams and my nightmares remain Silent fields of despair my tears in the rain
