Mother earth looks at her closely She looks at her baby and she sighs The slight breathing pause that she takes It builds her and makes her strong She refuses to give her up and we close our eyes Her hands touch the round stomach and feel the kick The eyes that have seen so much cry with the water She starts to rinse her face And refuses to give her up And we close our eyes And you close your eyes
