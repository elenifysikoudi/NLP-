Outside of this world There's a life force still burning Outside of this land There's a star shining free In silence we stand On a golden horizon calling This time has no light for us Still shining so bright for us Again Trapped inside this paradise still bleeding While there are so many faces in this mask of lies Blinded by the promises and the life in pain Now the time has come for all of us to rise Through the fires of hell between us Through a lifetime of our dreams Endless tears still burn inside Beneath the sadness of our screams At the edge of our forsaken lands Sign that we stand here alone Nothing to say when the evil finally burns We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone One warrior standing through a thousand years strong Our past lives still shining the starlight reveals Our glory remembered with the power of the steel And the winter rain will fall around the brave and fallen Like the sands of endless time they'll never be forgotten We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone For the last time we cry now for freedom Cast aside this dying world forsakes us Break the chains of our creation now to save our lives Blight of all eternity and the curse of steel Like the winter rain will tear the blazing skies From the wastelands of destruction With the fire we hold inside Rise again still glorious For the power of all man kind From the years of our forsaken lands Sign that we stand here alone Nothing to say when the evil finally burns We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone One warrior standing through a thousand years strong Our past lives still shining the starlight reveals Our glory remembered with the power of the steel And the winter rain will fall around the brave and fallen Like the sands of endless time they'll never be forgotten We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone For the last time we cry now for freedom For the trials of far behind us In the dark and burning skies Fallen tears still lost inside Within the memories of our lives From the years of our forsaken lands Sign that we stand here alone Nothing to say when the evil finally burns We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone One warrior standing through a thousand years strong Our past lives still shining the starlight reveals Our glory remembered with the power of the steel And the winter rain will fall around the brave and fallen Like the sands of endless time they'll never be forgotten We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone For the last time we cry now for freedom For the last time we cry now for freedom again
