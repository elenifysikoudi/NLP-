The flood of death all around But from your soul is the sound The sound of defiance and pride To prove your spirit's alive The seventh symphony calls To beyond city walls Surrounded for 900 days But you will never give way You fight You stand and fight Fight for your life Stand and fight stand and fight for your life Frozen so hard is the ground The fallen lay all around A great patriotic war Starvation taking you all Eat anything to survive Because you refuse to die Dying and dead everywhere But you refuse to dispair You fight You stand and fight Fight for your life Stand and fight stand and fight for your life Don't take a single step back While you are under attack You stand against tyranny With just your humanity You stand your backs to the wall Forsaken ready to fall You won't surrender your pride Your pride is holding the line You fight You stand and fight Fight for your life Stand and fight stand and fight for your life
