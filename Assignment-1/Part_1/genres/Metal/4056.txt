I can hear the silence calling Curtains of darkness fallen Together we will stand side by side I can hear how the wind blows And how the sun glows It's safe to walk to home once again Everything is so calm And you presence is so warm I feel safe when I'm held in your arms As the moon enters the skies I look into your eyes There's one question without and answer If I were you king would you be my queen Together we could stand united hand in hand Like the stars in the sky just like them you and I We can stay forever together I believe those words you say I know that we could find the way Together we have to make it true Now remember these words of mine I'll always stand by your side I feel safe when I'm held in your arms Everything is so calm And you presence is so warm I feel safe when I'm held in your arms As the moon enters the skies I look into your eyes There's one thing I want you to know Now when I'm your king and you are my queen Together we will stand united hand in hand Like the stars in the sky just like them you and I We can stay forever together We will live like the King and the Queen Now when I'm your king and you are my queen Together we will stand united hand in hand Like the stars in the sky just like them you and I We can stay forever together We will live like the King and the Queen
