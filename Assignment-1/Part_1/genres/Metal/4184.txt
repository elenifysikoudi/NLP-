Voice of an aeon Angelus satani Ora pro nobis Lucifer You alone have suffered The fall and torment of shame I'll smite heaven's golden pride And never pity thee Immaculate divine Satan of Elohim None dare to stand in your way Thou bow to none Of Eden's feculence Conjure the serpent messenger Savior world's decay Concord in temptation And in the fall of Eve For Thine is the kingdom And the power For Thine is the kingdom And the glory Forever Scholar of the unlight Great volcano of excrement Rippling eager to erupt Reconstellate the firmament Behold the great accuser A megalinga of throbbing zeal Raptor yearning to pierce To rape the seventh seal Destroyer of cosmos Implore the unGod Implode the Sun There's none wronging the serpent's cult Untouched and ignored With the serpent's might And the trumpets blow In the shadow of the horns For Thine is the kingdom And the power For Thine is the kingdom And the glory Forever Lightning that stabs the heavens Thou quiver the Mount Sinai Spit rocks on tablets of cofenant Listen for the tempest's rasp Azazel Apolyon The black sun never sets For it never rose Habemus Satanas The Caesar's wrath Empire's fall Petition the lord with fire Santa Sede burns Phallus Dei Erect from pole to pole Viva blasfemia In coitus infinitus Hear the universe scream Bleeding from black holes Whom horns careless And whom God mourns
