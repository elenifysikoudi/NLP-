What is left of our world today Walls have fallen with peace But walls are built within our hearts Wars are fought within A cloak lies over our world A misery show without an end The masses follow the masses The blind will lead the way To see the colors that rest within your mind The paradise we seek lies inside Who's to blame who will lose Now the dice have been rolled We must find the guilty ones Instead of condemning what has been done Who shall we praise now When all our gods are gone Living is not just to live In a concrete or cardboard box Think in a carbonized world Where all has been done before The thought of a perfect world On a pile of broken dreams To see the colors that rest within your mind The paradise we seek lies inside Who's to blame who will lose Now the dice have been rolled We must find the guilty ones Instead of condemning what has been done >From the smoking cities we shall rise And on the ashes we will build Praying for that one day The sun will rise again
