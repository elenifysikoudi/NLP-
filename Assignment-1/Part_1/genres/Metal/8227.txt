Together as one with the cracked mirror reflecting only this unborn unknown I've never flet this emptiness like a cascade of teardrops in blade forms Decisions to choose the arcanum one I'm slowly fading into the dreams of the universe Do I really feel the tragedy Where are those grey moments of pleasure I'm the dawn I'm the night I can create and destroy I will always be the lonely walker Together as one forutne and misery I'm a warrior full of hate and wisdom full of pride and sadness Soon I'll cross the river of fire soon I'll face the Final Battle to revenge all those soulless Lost Years
