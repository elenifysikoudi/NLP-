Moonlight Descends in the land of shadow Full moon is rising Over blood red skies Wolves Cries in the freezing night Gathered in twilight To summon the master below Rising shadows Over blood red skies Mournful cries Through the darkened night Darkness Spreads in a shape of evil Over the rising kingdom Transylvania Shadow Surrounds the ancient castle The palace of death far away Where no light exists In the realms of Transylvania Purest blood shall flow Mortals shall feed Hunger undead souls Shadows Over Transylvania Darkness In the land of frost Whispers In the winds of evil Storms In the blood red skies Shadows Shadows Shadows Shadows
