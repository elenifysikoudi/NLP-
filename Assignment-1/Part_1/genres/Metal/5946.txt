Say my name Say my name Your angers on fire Will it ever be the same If I came back to stay and if we started all over again What difference will it make to you Will it all remain the same Will you ever fight again will you stop confusing me with all your principles Theres no excuse for your abuse I hope you understand I hope you wont pretend I cant believe I had to go through all of this with you I didnt believe Id last this long What difference will it make to you I hope you understand I hope you wont pretend Say my name dont try to hold back There is no price for all your attacks Given that you had no one Given that youll be alone Given that nobody cares for you Say my name dont try to hold back Your fence made up of ruins and walls
