Alone since I was born Cold limbs turned against me Take a part in my misery Silence causes me pain Please alleviate my loneliness Be the one who never betrays me Is Heaven a goddamn freakshow Hell can't be more horrifying Let the end come and set me free I smell blood in the air Death is waiting with open arms Come to me fill my body Let Devil in Devil's in Let the Devil fill my damn body Let Devil in Devil's in Yeah let him come to me Don't forget there's no way back A new star on the sky is shining Let the end come and set me free I smell blood in the air Death is waiting with open arms Come to me fill my body
