An uprising empire ruled by the antithesis of tolerance thousands of doomed empty animas bound to the tyrant's will The sand castle is raised the sand castle must be brought down With insincerity they led their so called brotherhood to an undesired slaughter With insincerity they led their so called supremacy right at our feet Who will protect their beloved families when our vengeance unleashes The hangmen implore for amnesty as their lives depend on a mere trigger pull At this point of my journey I can't discern between mercy and scorn place your bets let's play roulette with my heart as the croupier Will this be the time for the final retaliation or will my pride submit to my regret once again To the rhythm of another song about honor and purity I close my eyes and trust the righteousness of He who holds the fairest perception And so the most important decision was taken in the smallest of times The curtain of obliviousness surrounded the scene a gunshot in the dark Make them perish Today I will avenge our fallen Today I will avenge our fallen and there will be no sunrise for you Please forgive me Redeem me from all my sins for I will bring peace at last after the rivers run red
