You've got to choose that what side you on boy To win or to lose to build or to destroy Move on with this muthafuckin breakdown Bring down the whole town if you hear this sound I'm here again stronger than ever Face of an angel soul of a devil Learn like a newborn wise like an old man Your worse self who just can't be beaten You can't see me You can't hear me You just feel me Invisible enemy a shadow that bites You're so weak with blood in your eyes This mental pain an inner shout A part of your mind but I will get out
