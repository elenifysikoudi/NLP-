Inside me anger builds like a blaze from below Mindlessness causing this that is out of control Inferior are the thoughts and ideas which you think For the light at the end of your tunnel is to late Do not taint the ground in which I walk on Do not defile the air in which I intake For you and your cortege are disillusioned Disciples of this dreadful epidemic The intellectual has no meaning as I lay silently screaming for those of simplicity to awake and reach for the edge that I take Looking down up from this tower I watch those shake and cower The time shall come and none to soon when all the frail shall meet their doom Let the weak play with weak let the skilled be by skilled Let the sounds that are clear soak in and be filled In the heads and the hearts of the ones that are true Like the moon in the sky it will surely shine through Do not taint the ground in which I walk on Do not defile the air in which I intake For you and your cortege are disillusioned Disciples of this dreadful epidemic
