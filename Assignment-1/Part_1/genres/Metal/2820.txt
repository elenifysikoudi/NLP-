I calm the storm for a while And stare into your tearful eyes Hide your fears deep inside Behind your veil of lies Born from the sin filth within I am the fear in your dreams Hide your tears cry within Then learn what fear really means No salvation the past can never be changed The book is written in blood of their enemies All your lies and your cries Now you shall pay in blood Endless pain you shall gain From trusting the book of lies No repent christian friends Your god can't save you now Watch the dawn last in time Before you leave this life There is no time for salvation And nothing can change what you've done Tear out the pages and burn them And rewrite the chapter once more
