The Czar went down to Catherine city When peasants clamp in feeble things are trampled down Is the flesh of a symbol doomed worth any pity Did the rituals bring the force unto the imposter's crown Scenes from the cycle of life and of death under God Some of Your sons bleed Some of Us burn You make us and we make You This is what we get in return Master the power we yielded is fading away The bunker's dug deep but they've been knocking a million Times I formed Your fire into an all embracing light When dawn breaks I will come with You into the night Scenes from the cycle of life and of death under God Some of Your sons bleed Some of Us burn You make us and we make You This is what we get in return
