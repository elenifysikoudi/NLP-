You scream don't look you scream don't touch What have they done What have I not And every time I think about your voice I Start to tremble and my throats aching And anytime you need a shoulder I'm right here You've just gotta find a way She sits alone tries to adjust She cries please let me go I won't tell anyone You scream don't look please god don't touch Oh God please help us get her out of this
