When I look My face behind Cannot hide My soul is screaming Like a dog Whine I through life My part is leaving I survive I survive Let me in Inside the room The room where I I'm screaming To be not here I'm feel alone Where is the new beginning I survive I survive When I look behind There are scars they're screaming All this discord in life And I'll survive Be my own God That's all I want Together as one Oh I miss it too long Without all These fullfilments I'm only a half human being I survive I survive When I look behind There are scars they're screaming All this discord in life And I'll survive and I'll survive and I'll survive and I'll survive Survive Now I'm back here In my real world I'm very proud of it To be present again On my holy place Where I belong Don't try to ban me cause I'm to strong When I look behind There are scars they're screaming All this discord in life And I'll survive Survive
