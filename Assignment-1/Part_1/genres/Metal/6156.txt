Memory of these blood stained faces In the darkest corners of primeval wisdom She lays awaiting the masters of faith Mistreated actions take form in an outlet to avenge this rage Drowning within the spiral of this hellish plane A naked body layered with sigils of this summoning These preaching altars transformed for consecration Like blood and fire In the sacred chalice of Satan I hail the blood stained horns The goat of a thousand young Clandestine episode of inflicting torture On the self to culminate the powers of evil An urge to take lives in these sadistic ways Reflection of horrific gaze Frozen with blurred visions Trembled lips beg in whispers To represent the force of this offering Convert the virgin essence In offers of rape to the black goat Sanctified gestures of the perverse Attained in the source of anointing the God of fire My name is spoken Echoing through the void Disciples of the damned March into the fires Treacherous disciples That brand the names of hell across virgin skin Forcing a trauma that induces this demonic hallucination Bleeding soul of the virgin whore Swallowed in the storms of flesh A rising dawn of cruelty Awaken the impure Perception of the deviant to the judges of mankind Slashing her wrists and arms in hell their hearts lie This proof of devotion It had death's face Anticipate the cry of a hundred prayers for the release of pain This eve of lucid conjuring Defiled notion of praise Fatten the beast with her flesh Her screams are unheard except for the dead Adorn this whore of God with horns Screaming fury of eternal escape Conceptual journey to seek the birth of evil Arouse her fury in various states of amputation Crawling epidemic in quiet confines This falsified concubine of the heavens
