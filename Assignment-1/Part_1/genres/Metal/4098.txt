I am thine own begotten Dionysus Divine Mars thou call'st me son And thou Apollo my begin gav'st me That dream hath my mind inflamed And everyone a star hath become My brothers and sisters in cosmic ectasy Millions of sins and virtues were they And all the whole wealth of my life That neither the end nor the beginning had I could bestow Star Spawn Exploring our gracious flight hiher We could make love to numberless stars With our tiny hand the world embrace Learn it and forget it be begotten and die Forever exist only mightier and absolute Myself am Solaris Universe and oneness Nothingness and chaos am I The last bow to thee Earth before I ride a cosmic snake and devour the stars Before I become the beast And no mortal man durst my magic defy Planet Satan receive the eternal possessor Me for myself I ascend thee Me for the world
