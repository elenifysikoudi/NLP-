This is the story of the Antichrist's son born from the union of two Not from a virgin alone as for god the son of perdition he will be born in sin Like the great serpent in the wayside he sits Waiting to wound those who justice's path walks They will be killed in an agonizing death Struck with the poison of his wickedness God he raises the lowly our king he casts them out Instead of condemn all the sinners they will be magnified Sin stand for beauty sin stands for life Sexual sin is every man's right He will exalt the wicked of man Our king the Antichrist Just as the lord and redeemer foresaw A suitable place for his son to be born So did the devil he knew a place From which all evil could root It was Babylon He will come to Jerusalem with various tortures And slay all the Christians he can not convert to his cause He'll destroy the human race as far as he can And on the last day He will destroy himself God he raises the lowly our king he casts them out Instead of condemn all the sinners they will be magnified Sin stand for beauty sin stands for life Sexual sin is every man's right He will exalt the wicked of man Our king the Antichrist Sin stand for beauty sin stands for life Sexual sin is every man's right He will exalt the wicked of man Our king the Antichrist
