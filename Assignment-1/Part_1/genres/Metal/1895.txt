Sometimes I feel I'm not the same All alone in the hall of shame Don't ever want to be The one who I have to be Don't wake em up inside me Don't let em out of me If you want to taste how I feel Dial the number of fear Use it but never get used to it If you get used to You will be used by Dial my number Dial the number of fear Enjoy with me these uncertain moments Of life come and turn into nonsense Step out of body through your mind borders Feed carefully my inner sleeping monsters
