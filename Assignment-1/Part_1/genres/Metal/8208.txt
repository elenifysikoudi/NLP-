"I want to find the end of the road And I want to sing the mysteries of my penance Because I hear the tears of the trees And I feel the fire in the rain Once there was light a dream of an Astral Spectrum Until what's eternal dies until the unknown be known I'll fly in these spheres of hate chaos and ignorance I'll fly While I'm sitting on the Darkside of the very moon Tears approach the grief of my internal void Tears approach the grief of my internal void The Gray waters will tremble in my rise I will be the spirit of the storms My essence will be magnificent The bleeding eye will control my Faith These Cosmic landscapes of sorrows The misery in the Mistery I'm the Master of myself The creator of my will my will ""I'm finding the way I see what they've done The end of the dreams is near but first I'll kiss The end of the road """
