We ride along the great riverside Ever so wide The giver of clarity She will be wise enough To make us understand The moment we reach heavenly land Heavenly heavenly We focus on we follow faithfully Faithfully faithfully Slowly and surely we'll find our way The ever present unexpected life is All that we wanted All that we choose to lead We will rise and fall And all the chances in between I try to move you to open up your mind These barren city grounds Make you never look behind One day you'll be wise enough And you will understand The moment you reach heavenly land Strong winds on desert ground Release the tendency And hold it like a cloud Enlightened and breezy Hence the strain it brings If only we understand Strong winds on desert ground Foresee our lives
