pity's a frozen bed pity's an arrowhead pity is what threw me to your side i loved you conditionally exceptions like sodomy i don't know where fairness lays it's head burning scars along my face i should have sent him on his way i loved you like i love myself a dusty gap left on my shelf when slipping eyes perch on my head i know my inspiration's dead we're classified but we're simply broke and luckily we just have one throat to choke
