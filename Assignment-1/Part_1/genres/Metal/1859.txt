I hang down helpless into the water Impaled to a piece of iron can't stand it longer Past n future are the same I've got to forget myself I count on nobody only on my help Victim of this goddamn society system I'm my innocent but noboby cares bout the life of man And that's what you call as a civilisation in my opinion it's just the drug of sick nation Flowin Time Timeless Space Space in Mind Mindless Race Just look around in our goddamn world I think it's the wrong way it has turned I feel like my brain falls apart in a minute I've done nothing but I have to suffer for it Don't you feel yourself guilty for the life of some people Who sink deeper n deeper while you burn in money fever Living in this mass it's just less than a wonder Your fuckin business why I have to go 6 feet under
