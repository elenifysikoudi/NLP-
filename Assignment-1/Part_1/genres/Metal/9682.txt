No more livestock no more listlessness As long as we're quiet our dreams are blessed by hands that smite and feet that clatter against the roof of time uncertainty will shatter Open rise a choice career for all rebirthing Stop drown they drank my words till drought and chatter No refunds today a wretched toil awaits below the face that smiles ok with teeth that shine like a health freak show From hibernation I slither into your barren bed we'll guard our freedom A world of protective padlocks lies ahead Open rise a choice career for all rebirthing Stop drown they drank my words till drought and chatter
