It's a different day your time has come The lying interests betray you Don't think about revenge forget it There's nothing you could do Your way has been written Have patience in silence Believe in the power of faith Wear your crown of violence Rusty nails through your flesh Endless gate in the plane Into the immortality Will we rise again Don't you feel fear They expel you in the protection of innocents Suffer for our sins your body cries blood The torture never ends
