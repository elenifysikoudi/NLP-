Yeah I'm leavin the same way I came in It's lookin forward but I can't see straight It's just like I know where I'm going It's just like me to fool myself I'm right here bitch Buried by the words of a liar I'm right here bitch But I'm alive and I'm still breathin yeah That day becomes so haunting You didn't say enough we were mistaken' My mind plays it over and over Slow motion But we're moving faster moving faster So much further Let's not lose control Light a match just to watch it burn Struck Light a match just to watch you burn Where are you goin How far Where are you goin Let's give them HELL That day becomes so haunting You didn't say enough we were mistaken' My mind plays it over and over Slow motion But we're moving faster moving faster So much further Let's not lose control I'll bite the bullet Just to save myself Oh Oh no this ship is quickly sinking We gotta take control gotta take control Oh no this ship is quickly sinking We gotta take control gotta take control
