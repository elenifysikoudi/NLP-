There's no remorse within my soul And I don't lament pain In fact I enjoy it I was all born in an act of laceration I feel I must leave a sign of my passage If they only let me go now Because I have to follow my fate I'm disgraced We have travelled through chaos All around there's only misery Ignorance and sadness the pastfinder returns All around there's only misery ignorance and sadness why Many signs of the past that I found Only echoes of triumph and sorrow Of grief and past joy
