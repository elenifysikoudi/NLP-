Towards the light I will move on And so I learn to move The one before the next The steps I take Will pave the road ahead of me I awoke this morning Wondering if I was alive My head was spinning in circles Turning to the other side Bare and broken i hold on to walk I stumbled over my body I stumbled over my words On control upon all wasted As if I were beyond belief Bare and broken I hold on to walk Towards the light I will walk Faster than The speed of mind Both my arms are wrapped around This new experience My head in clouds My feet firmly on the ground Towards the light I will walk And wrapped my arms around the ground Beneath my feet Towards the light I will run Towards the light
