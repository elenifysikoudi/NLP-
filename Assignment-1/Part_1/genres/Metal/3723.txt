Fell the wind blow across the moon lit sky Sense it coming with from deep inside Never in the deepest darkest dreams you dread Did you think that this would come but it has Listen hear us call with the gusts when it least expected Blasts of the snare fall like hail across the horizon Pulling at the core crafted by hands of lords Violence filled with fury lightning strikes now it has arrived As it drives This is the storm the storm that will rip your souls apart This is the storm feel it pound within your heart This is the storm The storm that will steal the breath from you This is the storm Leaves you gasping and cuts right through The wretched voices that you hear slowly begin to take you in The wretched voices that concur there will be no equal ever again low end rumble shakes the ground making a volcanic sound If there were lava it wouldnt pour but beat you down like you were a whore Embraced without arms when all is done thus we return again Like a wave drowning you in a sea of black that Leaves not a thing not a trace of the power that has passed Memories all thats left no doubt you will meet it again And again This is the storm the storm that will rip your souls apart This is the storm feel it pound within your heart This is the storm The storm that will steal the breath from you This is the storm Leaves you gasping and cuts right through All the silence has been broken and the eye has passed on by The plurality has spoken even though one has not died Keep an eye cast high above the moon and stars and weary nights For when its least expected thats when the storm arrives
