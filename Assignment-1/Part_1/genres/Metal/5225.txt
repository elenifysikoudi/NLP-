So I sit and wait for time to pass for you to brake these chords bless me with distortion I stay up Wait for things to change Hoping for that single call To tell me I'm ok Will you slay me Will you let go already I can't cope this I am fading I walk in circles forever Charging up everything pass me by I am the liar in this deception As well as the deceived open up Shut me in I need you now get out
