Lyrics Angela Gossow This is the age of dehumanization Perverted creation Damned misled children You never stood a chance Resurrecting a dead messiah For a paralysed race Damned misled children You never stood a chance Infected Neglected The new breed of a generation to come Rejected Ill fated The new breed a generation to kill Sowing the seed of suffering Upon these fertile hearts Damned misled children You never stood a chance Chosen to be slaughtered By the masters of manipulation Dmaned misled children You never stood a chance
