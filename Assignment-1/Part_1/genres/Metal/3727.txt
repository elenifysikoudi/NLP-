Images in the night sky casting spells on those who gaze into the night sky I see mystique and chaos in the lights In the night sky leaving trails that linger across the night sky Graceful they seem as they dance along the black As they dance along the black Blazing through the stars shining within the arctic landscapes Behold this phenomenon's beauty Arise within the Northern horizon Discern I am the lights they are with me inhabiting inside the verve feeling the sense see how they gleam with luminous rays through the air curtain of light opening slow revealing tales of long ago forever will the glisten be upon the land not faltering Never will the shining fade until the end The end of time Blazing through the stars shining with the arctic landscapes Behold this phenomenon's beauty Arise within the Northern horizon
