As blood stains soil underneath the rejects of the light Everything that stands shall burn in fear of the dark lord In this rage of storm I hear the pouring drops of blood Entrance to these shadows of the devil Towers of light fall into this endless abyss As monoliths of black arise This fear now bleeds the storm like flames engulfed in darkness Passing days of despair restless in these hours of suffering These sharps claws of death yearn for this warm crimson touch Swarms rage as demon hordes rip forth from my chest Warm red streams explode beneath my hands Moments closer to death to be swallowed into black Embrace this deception for birthright in self pain Reborn as a shadow in the black inside the fires of hell The bloodlettings of suicide flood onto the cold dark inside the mind Drowning in the soft flames of hell within this the scent of decay A voice of fire from within the sleep of shadow This place of weeping for the children of the light I am absorbed in the drowning of fire inside the catacombs of hell Enslaved by the scythe of Azrael with hallowed souls The thirteen now await the black serpents bringer of death These children of the light lie silent in the dark This sea of blood for joining in spirit descent Shroud of ruin within this scourge of bloodshed Rage in tainted blood that blinds all of the light Entrance to this embrace inside deception Elegies of lament for the thirteen children of the dark Lying still Satan opens the dark I embrace deceit whispers unto the dark Voices fall silent as ghosts of their screams Throbbing pulse of this becoming as the blade cuts through flesh Echoing this haunting curse of cloven whispers I am the depths of hell I call out from the blood Up from the darkness I call out from hell I am dead in this world A flood of death in blood Commanding this death that light has bled Abyss is open within me I purge this sea of blood Symbolized in agony through this praise of the blade Awakening the Impure as we drink their blood in the name of the dark Where I am drowned by the blood of hell
