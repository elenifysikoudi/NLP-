J Hall K Holz Self destruction enters the sky All beings are going to die Pandemonium carries out Hurry up scream and shout Self destruction is on its way Don't interfere or you will pay Hold out for one more day Or you might end up far away In the end it is black and grey There's no one at the end of the day All you must do is pray For Self destruction that is far away Chorus
