Darkness spread its dark wings Whispers of woods were growing With every moment I felt them paying enormous tributes Powers which were still alive at night In the battle of light with dark earth Spirits of their own nature fight proudly Live by my side feed young heart of mine But I cannot ever see them I don't know her powers but I know it's great Loves gives birth kills it's powerful She raises beautiful monuments by the Baltic Lives when I sleep and lives in me At night raises over dreaming forests She awakes Gods and Goddesses unsilently The night cock she is whispers wolfish spells The chants of bard she knows and hums them Goblins of oaks and denizes of darkness Bathed in the wine of a delightfull night And lives there but dies at dawn Dies in me with barbarous voice The dark forest enchant me
