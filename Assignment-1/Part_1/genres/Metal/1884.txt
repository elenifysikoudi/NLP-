You think that you are God A lot of money that's all you've got Inside you are not worth much so Don't play the fuckin macho Pase lo que pase Against us you're lost hombre We don't care for your lies You're nothing in our eyes Que gente es esa Adonde va a pasar Fuera al momento Don't play macho Don't show me your bitch mierda Mientras mas tiene mas quiere Siento mucho Not you are the money macho
