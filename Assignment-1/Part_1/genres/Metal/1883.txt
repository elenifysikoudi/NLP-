I'm sitting in a warm soft cradle I watch myself in the distance My joy flow becomes a deformed smile As recognition breaks my staidness Stroking wind rises shapes a funnel And takes me to another place Light lifts me up from depth But darkness numbs me on the surface Never never ever wake me up From my dream My body is choking in its sweat Everything prompts this idyll is fake Time slows down and gets off again Climbes up on my legs like a snake Adrenaline dope excites wish of life But the reality shackle binds me tight Wish of life pumps adrenaline dope Time just crawls and trails me slow Never never ever wake me up From my dream Light tears me from depth away The views before my eyes brightens I'm melted in the reality dimension As recognition breaks my staidness
