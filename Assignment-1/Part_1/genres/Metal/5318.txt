Turn on temptation arise tear the sky This nightmare is everywhere my eyes open wide Crash on through troubled waters oceans collide We stand alone until the end we fight side by side Standing strong together marching forever on Fire in the heavens now that our time has come We feel the fire burning bright in the night Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies Wherever you go we will be by your side For the spirit of ninja will carry the night The sky will turn black the nightfall appears The hatred surrounding they hide in great fear The evil all around the sound they will hear Will not be for long now the time it is near Raising hell forever still millenniums go by Fire in the heavens bleeding ears hear the cry We feel the fire burning bright in the night Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies Wherever you go we will be by your side For the spirit of ninja will carry the night Standing strong together marching forever on Fire in the heavens now that our time has come We feel the fire burning bright in the night Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies Wherever you go we will be by your side For the spirit of ninja tonight We feel the fire burning bright in the night Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies Wherever you go we will be by your side For the spirit of ninja will carry the night Ninja forever tonight
