Dark is the night of the dead lifted away from the skies Facing the truth of the emperor death to those of the light The people that you can't unleash Condemned to worship the holy cross Life is ending so fast darkness has showed up its singn Waiting for death is all that remains Slaving for the signs of god with your fate you will pay Every mark in the sky showing you you will die As the sky turns black you wonder why The reason of this you cannot try Creations of death creations of life Your kingdom has come your kingdom is gone Where the winds of darkness blows Thats where I lost my soul Where the winds of darkness blows
