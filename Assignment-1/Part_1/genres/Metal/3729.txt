Trapped shackled by four chains strapped to a wall tormented day by day living life in Fear hunger sets in now pain begins rats naw my flesh infected limbs are Left nothing to see nothing to hear only screams of anguish followed by Tears wishing to die the luxury its time I've lost control the sixteenth chamber has taken my soul Screams ripping through the air bloodstained walls everywhere People dying lives are lost this is my own holocaust Me existence torn from mind flowing fast like the sands of time Please lift this horrid curse living in a world of hurt Life line of consciousness overshadowed by lancination Barely subsiting breathing living with the dead Trapped shackled by four chains strapped to a wall tormented day by day living life in Fear hunger sets in now pain begins rats naw my flesh infected limbs are Left nothing to see nothing to hear only screams of anguish followed by Tears wishing to die the luxury its time I've lost control the sixteenth chamber has taken my soul
