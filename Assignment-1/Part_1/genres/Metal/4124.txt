Mightiest Self Cast out of Thy Elysium With blood of Nazarene I write the story of man Two thousand years Is nothing though it has been enough Come forth victorious Muting the foul angelic choirs None of thy empty gods shall ever stand above me None of thy weak brothers shallt ever share my blood My awareness catalyst of godhate I have spawned In sinister ecstasy eternally I decompose Race of man The errors of a wise make The rules Ye shall see Rather than the perfection of the fool The most divine I am many Among so very few Beyond redemption beyond the weak Thus I beheld the truth None of thy empty gods shall ever stand above me None of thy weak brothers shalt ever share my blood My awareness catalyst of godhate I have spawned In sinister ecstasy eternally I'm decomposed I am the pure flame that burns I am Sirius son I am the infinite space I am the most conquering one
