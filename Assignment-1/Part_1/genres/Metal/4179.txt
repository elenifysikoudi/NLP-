Ever since the Devil breathes My steps never outweighed the gravity ov hell So I keep praying for rain of flaming rocks To foster the symmetry ov worlds I had a vision ov the impenetrable darkness Never found on either side ov the moon It wields composure ov my soul That comes as one with the odium below Chant the psalm Non serviam Retrieve the pride Within and without I imagined the most ardent ray ov sun Like vulture hovering above my neck It burns with fever deep within my soul Erect in gloria to sin k into shame Oh Lord whence came this doubt Thou doth know I am all and everything Let loose my shackles Let chaos reign Infecting moral arteries Chant the psalm Non serviam Retrieve the pride Within and without
