"Pain your life is only a book of pain but your life it isn't very plain this possesion of hate need to be dread say for your defense ""All for one"" to be free And all your lies all your fucking lies There's like a swictch blade knife Lies like a blade see you tomorrow What do you gain You only say sillines it's the same this possesion of hate Where do you go You are a sinner a sickmen a stray lumb "
