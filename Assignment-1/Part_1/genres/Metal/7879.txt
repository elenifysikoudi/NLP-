Music Lyrics by Lord Ahriman Blackmoon Unholy master Satan take my blackened soul Show me the secret gate Where the lord of darkness rule Take away my life Take it far away Take it to the shadows I must die Into realms of darkness Where eternal shadows fall My soul shall be free Departed from the dying world Embreced by the dark lord My soul shall be immortal Forever and ever I follow My master Satans call In the sign of the horns Come and take my life In the sign of the horns I must die Satan hear my cries of anger Come forth from the shadows and take my life away Master sacrifice my soul Make me one with darkness Satan let me free In the sign of the horns Come and take my life In the sign of the horns I must die Into realms of darkness Where eternal shadows fall My soul shall be free Departed from the dying world Embreced by the dark lord My soul shall be immortal Forever and ever I follow My master Satans call Satan hear my cries of anger Come forth from the shadows and take my life away Master sacrifice my soul Make me one with darkness Satan let me free In the sign of the horns Come and take my life In the sign of the horns I must die
