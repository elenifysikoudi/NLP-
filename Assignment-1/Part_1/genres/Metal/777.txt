Without you without you Thenights are long cold dark Without you without you I'm yearning Foryour sinful touch Far away we will find our own way In decay we will fade into the light I know you're always with me Together just you and me I know you're right beside me The Ghost Within Me I know you're always near me Forever we will always be I feel deep inside of me The Ghost Within my Heart Without you without you I feel so empty inside Without you without you I walk into the endless night Far away we will find our own way In decay we will fade into the light I know you're always with me Together just you and me I know you're right beside me The Ghost Within Me I know you're always near me Forever we will always be I feel deep inside of me The Ghost Within my Heart Far away from the lives we used to know All I ever wanted was to be with you
