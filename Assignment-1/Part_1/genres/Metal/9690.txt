A palace of crystal on a postament of slime Rule of refinement rats in the cellar Restless and climbing as slime and mud come Flooding Grace greased by ingratitude and greed By a despicable debris of delinquence and Debauchery The palace is of crystal but the postament is Slime House man built House man built This house was built God is dead Dead is gone God is gone No body's found unstable ground But the house was built Throw out the ballast and the vessel will be Faster The called are over crowding the market Let the chooser be the market And the loosers we'll wall out all the loosers And those among us who turned foul they're growing more For every hour The rich are getting richer the poor begin to steal As multiplied police force feels more righteous than wealth Program Gaps widening till it bursts asunder Threw out the ballast and the vessel went under House man built House man built This house was built God is dead Dead is gone God is gone No body's found unstable ground But the house was built The scene is set for a grand new war This war is final no new markets to explore This war will transport us through door When all is fire God will set the score House man built House man built
