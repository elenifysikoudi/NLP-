J Hall K Holz Sleeping in the night it hears a sound It gets up to take a look around It finds there's no one there It falls into a Black tears nightmare Darkness surrounding hells breaking loose Tries to get out but its no use Faster and faster it starts to turn Better slow down or it will burn Schizophrenia passes into the mind Thinking that it will painfully die Clasping and grasping for a breath It learns that it is near death Chorus
