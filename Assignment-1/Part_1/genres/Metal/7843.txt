I glare at what has become Under these darkened grey skies I cry out for my death To seek the land of horror and pain These piercing blades of steel Is the way for us to die The sword cuts through the sky But no cries are heard not one I forever close my eyes Immortal I have become All life seeps from my skin My ambition is now complete I am the ruthless lord Of this ancient realm I spread this plague of fears As a saviour eternally damned In a world where the skies reign blood And the pitiful and weak are none All glory shall come again In these forms of purest black We praise the chants of war We slaughter the sick and weak Raise our swords to kill For our Reich of impurity and hate
