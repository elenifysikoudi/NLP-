Let me take you on a journey Let me take you out to find Let me take you to no boundaries through the deepest parts of minds Close your eyes this is the entrance Close your eyes and cross the path Close your eyes drift out slowly and let me work my craft I mimic the delusion when I drowned your fears I create the trepidation that can leave you in tears I weave the web that you could never fathom Enchanting bewitching enthralling is what I am I manipulate the thoughts that are flowing through your head I twist and I turn them a dream god is what I am A dream god is what I am A new day is dawning your eyes open wide feeling relief all their is is a sigh The nightmare is over at least for now I make the dreams Only I know how The sky now darkens the clouds roll in the same feeling suddenly begins with that same sigh your eyes reopen wide for I was only playing tricks with your mind Grasp my hand and let me full fill your fantasies In my world I control the line between dreams and reality I make the rules that control whether or not you will open you eyes again Let me take you on a journey Let me take you out to find Let me take you to no boundaries through the deepest parts of minds Close your eyes this is the entrance Close your eyes and cross the path Close your eyes drift out slowly and let me work my craft A dream god is what I am A dream god is what I am
