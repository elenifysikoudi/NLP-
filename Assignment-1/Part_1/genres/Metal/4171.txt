On the hill Where sun behind horizon hides There is nothing Except my breath And crux of events And some crux of our hands On the hill Where shadow wings fell Wind rose ye to song And we plunged in its deep And in plaintive waterfall depths Evanescent recollection of atavism Secret of living in ye death posture And then Your seal in the garden of dispersion Closes your mouth Closes your eyes Closes your ears In the fields of Eden Under your first tree's rotting root There is feast Typhon's feast And night came moonless But yet your light appeared Picture of sigilic angels Grafting in our holy body and mind
