Denial The first Sweeter than honey The second time What's left No time A pleasant surprise All the time Proof Always answers Sharing feelings With me I would like to clear it up for once Please Proof Safety at last Gone And I think all the time About the dawn and the night All the answers The wrong and right When we kiss when we fight And love in its most natural way All the time All of my life Till the fire's burned down again Proof It's all gone Away
