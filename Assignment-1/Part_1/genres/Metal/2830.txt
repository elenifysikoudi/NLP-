In dreams I have I feel you so are you even real I want so much to show you that I long so bad to hold you I can't say how I feel the words just will not spill I've tried so much to hold you I mumbled words behind you I played with your hair in class why wouldn't I just ask Cause I know you feel the same every night you say my name How I feel to today You can't imagine the words I'd say To make you feel like you're floating atop the world Even though I wrote this song I try to play along And act like you're not there it's so hard not to care So how are you good at it when I say hi you throw a fit I've tired so hard to hold you maybe this song will show you How I feel to today You can't imagine the words I'd say To make you feel like you're floating atop the world I know you cared for me I know you're right for me But no matter how hard I try all I do is cry How I feel to today You can't imagine the words I'd say To make you feel like you're floating atop the world
