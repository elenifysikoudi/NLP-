Messed up once again Told me it's okay But this path that I'm taking I'm lost in the deep end One last chance never more Told me it's all right In this sea of denial I'm cleansed in the fire So why is it me Am I blinded or too blind to see Am I too blind to see Why was I born Not a part of this society Again and again I tried So hard to reach for the stars But I failed you all Tried to keep standing tall Never had a real chance at all But still I'm searching Same thing different day Tried to make a change Left with nothing more to live for But everything to die for Humanity insanity the everlasting grip Lost all will to keep trying Our bed we must lie in So why was I born Not a part of this society Again and again I tried So hard to reach for the stars But I failed you all Tried to keep standing tall Never had a real chance at all But still I'm searching for Ten thousand ways to say sorry But life writes its own tragic story Time marches onwards and Nothing can ever be the same But we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow Break free from this lifetime of sorrow Years pass us by but we're all just a part of the game I tried so hard To reach for the stars But I failed you all Tried to keep standing tall Never had a real chance at all But still I'm searching For ten thousand ways to say sorry But life writes its own tragic story Time marches onwards and Nothing can ever be the same But we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow Break free from this lifetime of sorrow Years pass us by but we're all just a part of the game
