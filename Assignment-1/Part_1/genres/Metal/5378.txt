Inception Death's guiding us the way We fight till the end Among the ruins Illusion Of brighter days ahead Through confusion and hatred we try to understand In silence we stand alone Caught in the eye A quest for life beneath a stormy sky The strength to rise again Time to realize Our race has come to nothing We'll start it all again The sun is dead now Fading away forever The darkness prevails now But with the prayers of the dead Now a new light ascends from the stars Confusion The sadness and the pain Matricide the earth is now dead Remember the brighter days When hope and joy were shining in our hearts Times have changed now we suffer yet try to understand In silence we stand alone Caught in the eye The fragments of my past to realize It's time to rise again In the world's demise Our race has come to nothing We'll start it all again The sun is dead now Fading away forever The darkness prevails now But with the prayers of the dead Now a new light ascends from the stars The sun is dead now But in the end what did we learn The sun is dead now Fading away forever The darkness prevails now But with the prayers of the dead Now a new light ascends from the stars Now a new light ascends from the stars
