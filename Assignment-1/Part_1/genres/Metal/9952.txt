Beware the Beast of man For he's the Devil's pawn Alone among God's primates He kills for sport lust or greed The sacred scrolls The truth unfolds Shun him or become like him Shun him the Beast of Man Let him not breed in great numbers For he will make a dessert of his home and yours Shun him drive him back into his jungle lair For he is the harbinger of death The sacred scrolls The truth unfolds Shun him or become like him Shun him the Beast of Man
