Welcome to my sweet dementia I'm asleep so I only feel ya No one's here so don't be afraid of all the voices that you brought with ya I've been waiting so long I've been waiting for you so long In a safe convenient coma Take a look around in your head It's like you've been here before Did you ever think about that I've been waiting so long But now we have finally met I'm the voice in your head Lay down your head and fall asleep I'm your guardian angel I'll be here I take heed of your dreams eternally You don't know how much it means to me While you're asleep I feel so free Your dream is my reality 'cause you're dreaming my life And I'm living your dreams Welcome to my insomnia I can't sleep because I don't wanna No one's here but I'm afraid The voices close me into the world I made I've been hiding so long I've been hiding from you so long I slowly sink into a coma I take a look around in my head It's like I've been here before I have never thought about that
