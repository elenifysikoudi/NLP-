"""It's not a dream and it's not your imagination "" I'm lying in my bedroom restless at nights And feeling someone's lying next to my side I hear a heavy breathing someone's next to me And watching me Sweet dreams now come to me Your flesh is weak I sense and know it's presence yet I'm asleep Someone is preying upon my sleeping mind Whispering Calling desiring And squeezing with all its might It's trying to take over and choke me A nightmare seizes in a freezing grip I feel cold fingers running taking a grip This spirit lurking in my sleep And giving in I'll sleep forever more Sweet dreams now come to me Your flesh is weak I sense and know it's presence yet I'm asleep Someone is preying upon my sleeping mind Whispering Calling desiring And squeezing with all its might It's trying to take over and choke me ""The flesh is weak Walk in the spirit And ye shall not fulfill The lust of the flesh"" I sense and know it's presence yet I'm asleep Someone is preying upon my sleeping mind Whispering Calling desiring And squeezing with all its might It's trying to take over and choke me"
