Monuments of dying dreams As far away as Eden These hours standing still Finding comfort in a distant past Slaves of yesterday You are blind Blind to the sunrise A roaming spirit forever lost Among the living Walking down the fatal road Cursed to be left behind Slaves of yesterday You are blind Blind to the sunrise Slaves of yesterday Slaves of yesterday Slaves of yesterday You are blind Blind to the sunrise
