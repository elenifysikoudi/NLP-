This holy swine in slaughter profane in consecration Potent words of the nocturne cause the fall of faith Whore of sin to be washed away Watery grave for the birth of plague Burial of ideal with war and blood Worms from graves shall be born by flood Spoken words of the final war at hand Mouth of plague inhaling demise of peace Procession in cold blood Cursed hands of condemned Desolate waking loss of breath casting this mold of man's death Bound to this eternity of shame Embrace the blood black witch god Mouth of plague exhaling wrath Scathing grace unclean leach god Before the age when man was blind This urge of life was repressed by the light Now evil has made its claim With blood of virgin's grace Lustful taste in venom of this flame Feed my rage in rapture of pain Awakening slumber of the beast Worship in blood this great plague as tears are turned to stone Left kneeling to this inversion of grace Consume this word of deceit Cold of sky to be the hand of cursed decay within a silenced tomb Feverish mold to be cast beneath the layers of rotting earth The blood fills chambers of the lungs Stifling these last prayers Suffocate in embrace of tainted life Cold lips of spoken witchery Outer shell removed from the flesh The true offering revealed Legacy in this game of thorns Transition of birthing a sick king Forgiveness embraced as this noose is placed around my neck Salvation in failure condemns this soul to eternal black Venom seeps into the garden of god tainting this birth of grace Now lost to hell's hate these wrists shall welcome this escape Bastard in waking this scourge of storm from god Hellion to immerse in flood formed from the righteous Forging this worship to arise In this awakening of the emergence of the vile Vengeful cries Arise from hate
