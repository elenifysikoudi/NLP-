Behind those mountains is a land That is owned by geniune men They wear a stone around their neck Which they borrowed from a river That supplies them with food and nutritious minerals And if you follow the river to the north You find their place Where they hide their children and women The women who wash during the day Are so beautiful you fall on your knees start to pray The children are the ones that play all day Are happy and shining all these days Behind those mountains there's a life we can share Cause nobody dares Behind those mountains there's a life we can share Cause nobody dares What they need you can see everywhere An ocean of green grass the grazing buffalo Who they killed to have food and shelter In the winter when the wind is cold And a white ocean is all you see The women are still washing The children still play during the day And the men wear a buffalo coat to live their land That is cotton by frozen river As it's spring in the mountains I see Behind those mountains there's a life we can share Cause nobody dares Behind those mountains there's a life we can share Cause nobody dares
