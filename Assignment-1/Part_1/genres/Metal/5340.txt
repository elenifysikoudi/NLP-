In the darkness of the night in the shadows of the dawn It's turning black no looking back the sands of time are sown When the day will slowly end and the sun has turned to grey Will we feel the power of freedom with the dawn of a new day Over mountains paved with gold and through the valleys of the slain Our quest will lead us onwards to the journey of the brave When the time has come to stand for the power we believe We will ring the sound of victory for one and all to see Sometimes in your darkest dreams you will feel the haunting pain Silent tears of your hidden fears come to haunt you once again Fight on for the memories of the everlasting dream Their in the silent lands on wings of glory free We can go on forever with the darkness so far away And the warriors who live forever fight on to the end Across the highest mountains and through the endless seas Our journey ever onwards fight until we all be free Through the darkness shining the never ending light On through the days of glory rise towards the fight And one day we will find a way toward this distant golden age The cries of war will sound the day We stand before the dawn of a new world On through the raging thunder across the seven seas Cold winter skies are falling on the battles we have seen We can go on forever with the darkness so far away And the warriors who live forever fight on to the end Across the highest mountains and through the endless seas
