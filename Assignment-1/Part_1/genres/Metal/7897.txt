We come through the dampened fog filled night Our armor shook in measured beats Our weapons are carved with the symbols of the Great demon god We are inlaid with gore and grime From uncounted battlefields In the distant land The smoke witnesses our murderous path I summon the force of geburah Let go of your hate so long been sealed I need your strength that dwells within you Lend me your flame so the sinners can burn Christian souls cry the sweet sound of torment Surrounded by flames forever they'll burn Angels struck down evil prevail Like a cold hatred storm descended from hell We strike the earth with our lords furious hate I summon the force of geburah Lend me your flame so the sinners can burn Burn
