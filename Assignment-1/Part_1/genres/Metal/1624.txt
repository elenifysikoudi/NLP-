J Hall D Tretola The privilege has been given too much To forgive and forget for all you've done Now you have a label on yourself To show what's next to come You get so much out of all this Pain and misfortune to all your surroundings You never learned to stop your troubles Prepare to suffer for what you've done Stand alone in a place And no one speaks a word Different from other days Everything vanished No one learned Why are we waiting for the end I know its not coming We should leave it all Seeing what else it could bring Chorus Solo Things have to come now for you Add all this pain to all this sorrow You've got what you want now But you'll definitely pay tomorrow Chorus
