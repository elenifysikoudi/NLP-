Escape the lethal teeth of faith This snarling mouth that bleeds words of this darkness A binding obsession for the last grasp of air Procession in plagued blood below this horizon Embrace this stain of un divine Torture of sickness in consumed Helpless in offering of this confession Kiss of this lifeless transfer Escape these rites of the sky These torn wings of the defied Force this silent murder of spoken praise Beneath the regions of cold and flame Birthed from cold blood Symbolism of tainted thought in blood filled eyes Sinister laugh of disfigured ideals these hands were bound by nails My lips are glazed with words of rebirth in praise of death I grasp for air in the submergence of my own sin Clinical silence for the seed of disease Prelude to self divine assassination Breathless in ruin by the force of havoc Crawl with thorns adorned in punishment Hallucinogenic transfer in the precursor to hell The dark god and his desire whisper in transcendence Worship in slave tongue cold breath of the flame These scorns of reincarnating the black void Rust covered blades of this atonement The modeling of pain for torturers Hell's architecture of the human mind These hands were once drowned in blood Redeem this desecration Soaring on wings of despise divine image burns my eyes Sinister hands of restructure feverish mold cast in flame Bodies descend in sky of death cruelty of disease shall swallow breath Trial beneath great lake of ice forsaken lives of sin in sacrifice I give into the embrace of agony I am sinless within my own sin Accommodate this pain to preserve myself I must bleed my own infection of the light These burning wings of failure for this helpless prayer savior This breath of sulfur before death in altered divinity of wrath Legion in mirror like creation carrier of the great plague I kneel for this final redemption failing in countless sick prayers The hand of war raised from the blood of the fallen angels This skinned god of empty souls birthing disorder An altar of suicide in this timeless torment Current of life lost swallows me inhaling my breath
