Sun comes out Wakes me up Wanna sleep need to sleep Saw your face In my dreams Fade away far away Fade away fade away You took your time Passing by Smiles and tears No one cares Had you once Now youre gone Want you here Need you near Dreams and life it seems Are crushing boundaries in me Paper waves and seas Ride the tide with me Need to see Youre not far from me Im breaking time Crossing lines I start to run to catch the sun from falling down and burn this town I try to reach You slip away Cant you stay Please just stay Cold and warmth collide Turning dark and light inside Nights we over fly All logic gone awry To know we might not meet again I hardly bare to look at you In all this mess we dont complain we kind of always knew
