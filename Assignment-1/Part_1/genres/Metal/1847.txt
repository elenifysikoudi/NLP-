A dream made of plastic Desire sways me Death by the central power Will find you maybe Torture awakening Brain dead loneliness Mass drifts with the current Are they really humen I hate this techno logical belief I don't wanna talk to answering machines Mass loneliness in this age of disease Why don't you let me hide behind my dreams Soul has been left behind Blind fight into a passion Sell yourself as a member of the daily routine nation
