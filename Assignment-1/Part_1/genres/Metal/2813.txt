I feel much colder in my heart and soul My wrath is growing stronger every day I am the shadow in every night I am the demon born of black and raised in hate My eyes are bleeding those crimson tears My kingdom is calling stronger every day I am the silence in every night I am the demon waiting for the dawn to come I'm at the gates of eternal sin My kingdom come my will be done I'm at the gates to eternal sin still waiting for the dawn to come I scream in silence of pain and fear There's no salvation for all my sins The storm is coming the dawn of flames I walk the darkness waiting for the dawn to come
