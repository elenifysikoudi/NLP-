Giving our blood to the Doomsday Machine Fighting for ravaged land A worthless gain Marching on a dead end road Lead Christopher Amott A violent new disorder Feeding off mistrust Forgot what we were fighting for A worthless aim A victory stinking of despair Dead eyes See no future Falling from grace We are coming home Lead Christopher Amott Battalions of hate Seeking shelter in Hell Bloodstained memories Will we ever be forgiven Our twisted fate Time will tell Dead Eyes See No Future Falling from grace We are coming home Lead melody Michael Amott Dead eyes See no Future Outro melody Michael Amot
