Forget the shell liberate the will Let the body fold and die with their own And I have no eyes no soul left to hide We drop the vice embrace lightless rise Come inside those of the same mind I rise above the crippled earth Armed with spite we take our own lives Give light bring down this tyranny life Drawing blackened passion From the void that was our past Breathing hard with nervous right We challenge the will nervous right The flames will come down Bring the light from all around And rise will the freedom souls To spite the torrent life that keeps us down I rise above the crippled earth Behind the flames of human worth Now I've chosen the snapneck path I have I have gone They seem to be free I am I am far beyond They seem at home to me
