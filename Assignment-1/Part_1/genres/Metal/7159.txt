I SIT HERE AT MY WINDOW AND GAZE DOWN FROM THE SKY I TRY TO FIND MY STARLIGHT TO HELP ME ANSWER WHY RESTLESS DREAMS AWAKEN BUT WHERE DO I BEGIN ITS TIME TO RE IMAGINE ITS TIME TO START AGAIN WHEREVER YOU COULD GO ID SEE EVERYTHING YOU DO DRIFTING HIGH ABOVE YOU SOARING HIGH ABOVE THE SKY ID LOVE TO WALK THE GROUND AND SAY MY LAST GOODBYE BUT WINGS DON'T DESCEND TO EARTH THEY FLY LONELY IN THE AIR AND I WANT TO BE SOMEONE BETTER WHO WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL SO WARM TO BE THE ONE THAT STANDS BESIDE YOU HOLDING HAND TO MAKE OUR CHAIN A CHANCE TO LIVE AGAIN AND I WANT TO BE SOMEONE BETTER WHO WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL SO WARM TO BE THE ONE THAT STANDS BESIDE YOU HOLDING HAND TO MAKE OUR CHAIN A CHANCE TO LIVE AGAIN
