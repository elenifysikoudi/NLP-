Over the mountains again Wandering above the plains Far up on my mountainside under the fiery lights I call my world the mountains of fire I am watching the flames I call my world The mountains of fire and flames Fire and flames Upon the mountain I stand Horizon sights at my hand Watching all over the sky At one with the burning light I call my world the mountains of fire I am throning my day I call my world The mountains of fire Bound to my fate I call my world the mountains of fire I am watching the flames I call my world The mountains of fire and flames Fire and flames Over The Mountains Over The Mountains Over The Mountains Over The Mountains Over The Mountains Over The Mountains Over The Mountains Over The Mountains
