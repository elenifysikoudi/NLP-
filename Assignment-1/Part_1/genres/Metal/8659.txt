Burning all the lost hopes I was breeding turning cold nights into an autumn pyre after the silence you've broken after the aeons that have shone on your frail skin nothing has left of your eyes and nothing as left in your memories burning all the strong knots I was weaving bringing my life back to this blackened womb after that time has passed over after this storm that has turned into the sweetest rain hear what I'm saying I'm free on my way and I don't long for your frozen sun over the flames of a shelter that was never built to last we're forging our strength forging our fate forging our life with the bloos that we've spent blessed be these wounds blessed be my doom as I burn as I burn thy frozen sun
