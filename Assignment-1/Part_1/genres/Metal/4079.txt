I the Sun ov man The offspring ov the stellar race My halo fallen and crushed upon the earth That I may bring balance to this world I son ov perdition From sheer nothingness transgressed Unto the highest self to utmost freedom To explore the starry nature ov my rage I pulse ov existence The law ov nature undenied I hold the torch ov Heraclites So I can shake the earth and move the sun I divine Iconoclast Injecting chaos into my veins With life accepted With pain resurrected Is the embrace ov God in man profound
