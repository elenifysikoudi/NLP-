Outside the battle ragin death upon us No surrender unchained and free Insanity will lead to blind destruction Crush the evil the foul disease Our final destination reborn in darkness Watching and waiting destroying with ease The judgement day upon us as dawn is breaking Mankind will fall to the spineless deceived Fly through the storm power of the steel Striking with vengeance force them to kneel Soldiers unite force of the world Fight till the end we will die by the sword Fight on in foreign fields of mass destruction Stand as one no man left behind Our final victory tonight awaits us Slain in darkness behind the lines Raise the dead ride beside of me Fallen heroes of a thousand moons Blaze ahead the price that they now pay On the march to their doom Fight till the end we will die by the sword Light the fires of freedom on the shores of endless seas Wings of glory guide us on the path to victory Light the fires of freedom on the shores of endless seas Wings of glory guide us on the path to victory Outside the battle raging death upon us No surrender unchained and free Insanity will lead to blind destruction Crush the evil the foul disease
