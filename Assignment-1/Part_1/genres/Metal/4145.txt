Father Art thou blind and deaf Old man Decrepit and hideous Hidden in woods of madness and anxiety I am the beast thou the refugium of love Whereas your love as a cockroach Under my own boot I am the gehenna of humanity whereas thou art me mercy And what shalt thou need it for If the world shall fall asleep under my wings anyway I am the blood from thy limbs thou art the wisdom Is it a great one yes vain fools do beliefe in it They still go up in flames in anyway Devils tongue is the tongue of fire Yes the same that burneth thine houses Consumeth light and thy sheep damned And even their wool is shaddy and the meat poisonous Not for the hungry dogs at my table I shall destroy everything or not I shalt throw it to vultures to devour let them feast Devils tongue is the tongue of the night Whenever thou delight in this beauty Thou pour in thyself the wine of the underworld And whenever thou crave for bearing it There are only the whispers of trees thou can hear Hungry of thy love I am anticipating my time Devils tongue is the tongue of my father The one who with universe constituteth an entity Father who shall not sell thou out for any flirt Forlove affairs kisses of humanity Therefore give me his darkness Power might hope and fulfillment Give me his light It is the time for the feast of hell
