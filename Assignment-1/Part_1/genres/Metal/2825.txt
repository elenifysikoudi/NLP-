Awaiting the dawnless realms but a light from the past is too bright In clouds erased from the summer skies another winter awaits for me From the ancient winters of frost the sunset calls my name Leading me into seasons of front as the cold freezes my tears Greetings of fear from darkened skies creating fires of fear Greeting us all from nothingness keeping our fires burning I am the ancient one the dawn awaits for me Leading me into seasons of frost creation's calling for me I awake in the darkest time it calls me from my grave Immortal ones await the winter from the north As silence reaps the shadows of frost a path stands clear to me Leading me into eternal winters
