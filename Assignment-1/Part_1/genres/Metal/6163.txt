Stealing souls for an urge that was kept a secret Fade in this memory as these curses exit lips Digesting the power of dead space filled with betrayal This evolution has passed down these genetics of evil This message woes ripped of emotion Conspiracy of poison the target of bloodlust Black veiled whisperers touched by the wicked Grey twilight of this might a return from hell As the bloodstained vision engulfs this purpose Awaken in the eclipse of self consuming rebirth Peeling back the skin of flame to rise up from this fire These layers of apocalypse cover the sky in hatred Memories washed away in corridors lined with decay Demands by oblivious parasites of cradled fear Fluids drained in this task of a souls devourment Not a ray of light that breathes in this lack of hope Unleash the morbid hear the call of wounds This misfortune rules with a plague of rot Executing ritual mutilations of tradition Personal damage of bitter movements in staggered thought Scarification of entrance to this chaos Swine of forever butchering the ageless Suffocate them with this fire In strikes of rage flesh is torn by thorns that crown kings Effigy of a frozen vision severed of limbs cast from the bone of angels Distinct venomous behavior placed on this pedestal of the revealing terror This evocation of wrath These words that will take all life A mouthful of revenge Choke on the virus spreading within soaring deeper into the solar burn Entwined in the lateral movement above Flesh covered grounds of massacre Only the most deviant of these supplicants Will have forged the new worlds vision
