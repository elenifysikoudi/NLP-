The crest light of divinity will never shine Contemporarily refined through a catastrophic hell Buried deep within the blood of traditional revolution A distrust to decipher man's evolution The future never known A black hole of undivine nature for destruction of heresy The stellar cycle about to be sucked into the imploding dark star to resurface an early cycle of man for a new millenium Closure begins in collapse Dissolving into the raven giant We are timeless within damnation Outer descent thrown into a reversal of extinction No emotion within this promise of damnation On sorelines of the perverse The Armageddon of prophecies unfold This threshold of an event horizon Collapses into a closure of negative density Look past the stories of life Look beyond these lies of a garden of delight The serpents tale is only beginning of this interstellar rebirth Hell's cold fire Begin a cycle reborn Devouring of utopia Attain within non escape Haste to collide with this transi tional barrier that makes a dead man free The cold ground is a warm death that leaves the personal idea of dying a lonesome rebirth Grasp towards the sky from within this depression As mountains of scattered head stones lay A far worse burial stigma becoming the inquisition The black heart of cold faith Bare this cross a tranquil agnostic epitaph The delivery of a condemned ideal The veil closes its swollen eyes from above This bitter evocation sealing the blackness of love
