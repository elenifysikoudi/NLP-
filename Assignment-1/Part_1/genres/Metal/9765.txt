what crime is worth the signature right what lie is worth the sacrifice of knowing you are true to yourself of holding in a truce this our time in life I stand before the shell of memory To force remembrance through mortality I trust the hand that holds no life In death we find demands trust in death seems our one true right In death we hold subjective memories In life we make our name in forgery What's it worth to live in mocked reality What's life if yours is form indignity
