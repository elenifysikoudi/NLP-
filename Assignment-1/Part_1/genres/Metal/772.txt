Running hard through the snow No idea where to go Is there someone there in front of me Try so hard still can't see Change the path fight the urge To give up to let go Will someone come rescue me How did this come to be Far away from a normal town Feel so lost starting to drown I know who's done this me Not the work of a mortal being Came so close in the dead of the night Didn't hear a whisper but felt the fright Lifted high above me Shadows were all that I could see I don't know whom to trust Tell me where can I run To the left or to the right There is nowhere to hide I am just one of the many abducted No one is sane In the land of the Midnight Sun Still have so far to go Escaped their clutch that I know Are they coming after me Do I have a chance to flee A faint scream distantly Another caught and now is gone Why is no one helping us What's to become of us Far away from a normal town Feel so lost starting to drown I know who's done this me Not the work of a mortal being Came so close in the dead of the night Didn't hear a whisper but felt the fright Lifted high above me Shadows were all that I could see I don't know whom to trust Tell me where can I run To the left or to the right There is nowhere to hide I am just one of the many abducted No one is sane In the land of the Midnight Sun I don't know who to trust Tell me where can I run To the left or to the right There is nowhere to hide I am just one of the many abducted No one is sane In the land of the Midnight Sun I don't know where to rung Tell me who can I trust Far ahead behind There is nowhere to hide I am just one of the one who were taken No one is safe In the land of the Midnight Sun Whoa are you now I don't know whom to trust Tell me where can I run To the left or to the right There is nowhere to hide I am just one of the many abducted No one is sane In the land of the Midnight Sun I don't know where to rung Tell me who can I trust Far ahead behind There is nowhere to hide I am just one of the one who were taken No one is safe In the land of the Midnight Sun
