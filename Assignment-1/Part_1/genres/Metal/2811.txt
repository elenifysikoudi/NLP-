Time What is time The tale of pain and death the moments of our lives Pain never dies You only suffer more when death stares into your eyes Wounds never heal The scars are there to stay the memory remains Lost never found Your soul is let astray when your body fades away Never the same again Scarred by the years of pain Never the fool again Scarred by the years of pain To be dead is to always live in their memories And walk alone on a path of grief To be dead is to always scream at the silence Forever trapped in a place of pain Pain what is pain The tales are the pain The moments never die Dead are the lies The truth is here to stay As the liars fades away Lost never found Their souls are led astray Their words to be slain Pain never dies You only suffer more when death stares into your eyes
