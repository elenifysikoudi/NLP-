Running away hours or days Finally I'm free the gates before me I see Holding the stones must find a place to hide Must keep them away from the demonic shrine My army is fighting for me For the stones or we'll never be free Keepers of light Shall behold their might To arms of gods I will give my life Escaped from the dark Their light in my heart Divine was their meaning to keep me alive Now take these stones hide them like gold To place filled with love This is what spirits told We must fight for the stones to last standing man We won't see tomorrow they'll destroy this land My army is fighting for me For the stones or we'll never be free Keepers of light Shall behold their might To arms of gods I will give my life Escaped from the dark Their light in my heart Divine was their meaning to keep me alive
