J Hall This battle I fight all alone No one to help no one for my own Playing mind games with myself I'm still fighting all alone It leads to a place But I do not follow Straight paths everywhere No turns from the sorrow All this is hard enough But more is thrown at me You tell me to fight back Only a reason I can't see chorus You are like my shadow But only following at night During the day You are out of sight There's an unknown place Where things are slow Life's not so hard Where negativity is unknown chorus
