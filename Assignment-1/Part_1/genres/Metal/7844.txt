My darkest fears have become a frightening truth And the wounds are hidden so you cannot feel the pain For I have chosen the path of misery and sorrow And my skin will continue to wither and decay Happiness where are you Will this grief be swept away This madness must stop or this world I'll depart As reality blends into horrific dreams My departure from Earth is getting near And as I approach death I'll show no fear I need you here to ease this pain For I fear it shall never dissipate Yet you are so far away and the blood continues to flow I felt your warmth I can't touch your skin Remembering as the knife caresses my flesh And I summon forth suffering and despair Yet it is something I do not wish to do My blood absorbs the poisons Drugged confused the walls enclose around me My mind is so high my spirit continues to fall And the anguish recedes as life slips away Breathless I beckon eternal sleep For I shall live no more to be with you As I see your fate appear through the mist
