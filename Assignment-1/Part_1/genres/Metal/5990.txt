i see him turn away although my eyes are shut with emptiness and again the rain falls down together with me this blood in my body runs for you drink my tears as i cry my heart and my mind crave for you drink my tears as i cry it is sad how the rain falls down i see you walk away falling down i cry and sream your name and again the rain falls down together with me my ache is yours as i am drink my tears as i cry
