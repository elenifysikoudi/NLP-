Don't think I'm yours Don't try to own me I live my own life Let me live free Don't wanna fuck with me You're talking shit I see And you can easily find the devil in me Step back step back Here comes my turn Step back step back You'll see your body burn It's just a goddamn lie That you hide behind You've got the power of wealth But I've got my pride
