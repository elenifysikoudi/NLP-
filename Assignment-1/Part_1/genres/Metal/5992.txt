He's in a rush run He has to hurry dash He's in a rat race Never at a slow pace Forever dangerous And never serious Up on your energy Expect no sympathy Appreciation is overrated Resting is for fools He lets his blood boil Always in turmoil Blasting his every way Throughout the shortest day Forever dangerous And never serious Swimming against the stream And steal all of your dreams Aggravation is appreciated He'll use you like a tool Association is overrated Friends are for fools He's in a rush Fever round his eyes I do not dare and cross him He'll smash you with his lies Ever so dangerous He'll haunt you seriously I wouldn't go within a mile radius of him
