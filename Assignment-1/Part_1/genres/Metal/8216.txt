The entities of my lost dominion Those majestic bringers of chaos and wisdom Lead the rain of our discontent To this precious land we have returned To this decayed glory we have mourn But for what reason the temple of magnificence has been corrupted We have lost all the aura of greatness This fight we now endure is the penance we must suffer In the search of all that was and again shall never be Mindbending atmosphere of irrevocable doubts A sign of the strange anxiety that always have been within myself Am I not a warrior Yes the proudest of all lost in the foreboding darkness That covers the land of The Chasm A dark cloud of hate The infinite flame that burns this dream A sad message
