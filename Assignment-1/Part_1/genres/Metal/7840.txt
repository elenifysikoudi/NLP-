"I think about life and feel pure hate about being trapped here on this earth Envying all deceased souls who've passed on from this ruined plane My dormant hours are filled with fear my waking hours I will not face All will to life has expired I just want to fucking die The thought of life reviving is nothing but pure illusion This impulse to end my life keeps on echoing through my mind Wishing that I had the strength to extinguish the whole of mankind I know that this goal of mine will never ever be attained I hate this fucking human race for what they have all done to me Driven to this destructive state Guided by insanity The thought of life reviving is simply just pure illusion This impulse to end my life keeps on echoing through my mind My cries for help have gone in vain No need to endure this endless strain My screams of pain seem devoid of sound Comfort in death I now have found Silently pondering ""Why do I continue on with this life "" Silently wondering ""When I die will anyone even notice my demise """
