I break the chains who catch me now I can hide I destroy my bad habits who want destroy my mind tell me what I am and tell me never looking back in my dreams I repeat the words what now you hear I'll be your prisoner and you'll be mine Prisoner for seven years I dwelt in the palace of the exile now I have to come again To my hometown if they say I never loved you you know they are a liar come on take by the hand follow me across the sea this is the beginning of a new life our past terror our death in life peace is better for me a lot of things are better for me give me all I needed I can't loose this train
