" I feel the pain in my heart I must ride I escaped but I won't lose my pride My horse shall lead my way to Andoria town From there I can contact ""great Gods"" Spirits shall give me the power and force I remember how God's slain to the ground Screams of pain and spilled blood all around I still hear his laughter of triumph in my ears I no longer feel the power of ice Spirits will give me more strength to rise To Andoria now I must ride Now I must ride And contact Great Spirits they are on my side I must find a way to survive Way to survive His powers are great but I must not hide The Spirits will help me to fight The glory of victory is in my sight Now hurry my horse I must be there before the night I cannot fail After hours of riding I'm lost Village of Elger please help me you must I'm Sir Amardon I'm a man with honor and pride I will lead your way into that town Farewell people my destiny's found To Andoria now we must ride Now we must ride And contact Great Spirits they are on our side We must find a way to survive Way to survive His powers are great but we must not hide The Spirits will help us to fight The glory of victory is in our sight Now hurry my horse we must be there before the night We cannot fail"
