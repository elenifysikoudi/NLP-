From long ago before the storm I knew that I was alone Left to my world strange and unknown Now it has take its toll There was a dream that brought me here Far away far from my home There was a dream that brought me here Far away far away and alone Fate's not smiled down on me Still I cry for my reprieve Time slips by never here Always gone never seems so near All along you were the one That planted the seed deep inside me Dreams go on one into one Never a doubt that you were beside me Still I'm strong I will go on Even though you have abandoned me You've closed the door trapped my soul But one day I will be free Just let me be here in my peace Where I can be alone with thoughts No company just misery And the burden of what has become of us all There was a dream that brought me here Far away far from my home There was a dream that brought me here Far away far away and alone Fate's not smiled down on me Still I cry for my reprieve Time slips by never here Always gone never seems so near All along you were the one That planted the seed deep inside me Dreams go on one into one Never a doubt that you were beside me Still I'm strong I will go on Even though you have abandoned me You've closed the door trapped my soul But one day I will be free All along you were the one That planted the seed deep inside me Dreams go on one into one Never a doubt that you were beside me Still I'm strong I will go on Even though you have abandoned me You've closed the door trapped my soul But one day I will be free
