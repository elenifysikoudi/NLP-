Twilight moonrise Awakened by the moonlight of the transylvanian night I hear those mournful cries Whisper from the shadows Mesmerized by the moon I rise from my coffin The moonlight rays awaken my soul From my cold sleep so dark and cold As nightfall closes in I know the time has come When I spread my darkened wings and become one with the night Obsessed by eternal bloodlust Into the embrace of the skies I fly To satisfy my desires and kill once again Bloodfrozen Under the rise of the shining moon Bloodfrozen Through the night I'll come for you Midnight A nocturnal vision so cold The shivering light of the moon Mezmerize my soul Again I shall kill And end the lives of mortals I satisfy my desires With purest human blood I am immortal I am eternal Dawn As the rays of the moon fade away I return to the chambers of my castle Far beyond the realms the light Once enshrined I am Into an endless crypt of darkness I remain bloodfrozen Until twilight calls my name Bloodfrozen Under the rise of the shining moon Bloodfrozen Through the night I'll come for you To take your soul to hell
