I know the games they play But it's not for me to say They take the dreams away And only the scars remain I'll go another way Avoid the light of day And take a chance That will lead me back home once again It all comes down to this We must all coexist Welcome My Friend Of Mysery It's been so lons since we set on Our journey through eternity And all of the worlds we left behind Time has been kind to you and me No matter what comes we must carry on Flying on wings of destiny Through infinity and what lies beyond A tempting melody beckons invitingly Draws me closer to the force That keeps me Earthbound Our past is swept away Vanished into thin air They trapped us once again Now we take yet another futile spin It all comes down to this We must all coexist Welcome My Friend Of Mysery It's been so lons since we set on Our journey through eternity And all of the worlds we left behind Time has been kind to you and me No matter what comes we must carry on Flying on wings of destiny Through infinity and what lies beyond Just hold my hand And don't ever let go Follow me to the other side Where so few go
