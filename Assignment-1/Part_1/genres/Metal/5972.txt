Sail on silver wings Through this storm What fortune love may bring Back to my arms again The love of a former golden age I am disabled by fears concerning which course to take For now that wheels are turning I find my faith deserting me This night is filledwith cries of Dispossessed children in search of Paradise A sign of unresolve that Envisioned drives the pinwheel on and on I am disabled by fears concerning which course to take When memory bears witness to The innocence consumed in dying rage The way lies through our love There can be no other means to the end Or keys to my heart
