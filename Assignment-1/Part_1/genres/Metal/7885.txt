In the cold twilight I stand Watching the rise of the moon In my deep dreaming eyes The reflection shines so clear With the burning eyes of a wolf The moonscape I behold I can hear the souls astray Whisper from the shadows Oh beutiful night Thou art my mistress Enshrouded in thy mysticism Forever I will be Enwrapped in the darkness I wander across the fields Of this haunted land in solitude Enlightened by the moon I am eternal a life immoral in darkness Alone I have wandered in the mysteries eternal In my dreams I spread my wings Oh the winds are calling My cursed name In tranquillity I fly into eternity The silence is broken By my screams Oh mysterious night thou art my silent mistress Make me once more one with the dark Like a black raven I fly across the haunted fields Immortality Runs thick through my veins In endless shadowed time I've wandered through the night Ensnared by the moonlight I howl upon the dark Raptured by the winds That whispers in forbidden tongues I am eternal a life immortal in darkness Alone I have wandered in the mysteries eternal
