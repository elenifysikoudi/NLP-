Hope was always a friend of mine My trust in life won't ever slip by No way No I won't be afraid of the road in front of me Times are changing I'm not Even if it confronts me with reality The shackles are tighter The top's even higher We need to be wiser to move on Why don't you let us live our lives Let us be who we are While you're stuck in here for us nothing's too far Can't fool our thoughts we know what's going down And one day we come out of the background Why don't you let us live our lives We don't believe your lies About the future promised to be clear and bright Let us live And fool yourself That everything's alright Oh god Nothing's alright
