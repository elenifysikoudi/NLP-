Music by Nergal lyrics by Nergal I've met in surrounding me nature Spirits and deities wielding the element In a field in a forest in rocks and caves and I won their goodwill with sacrifices Horses carried me to the skies White beautiful steeds beloved I was attacking brushwood violently I touched motherland PERCUS Magic circles and black stones PERCUS Forest spells and damned souls PERCUS I find worship in you PERCUS They will return dance like fire as before They will return to the trees to the forest of mine to the kingdom The thunderer demons guards of sacred spot during those cold nights they found peace and consolation Between the gates of Pomeranian kingdom of magic They will reign again the thrones of mighty fatherland I rediscover their power and charm To defeat like a sorcerer Like thousand years ago oaken castles from millennium before They will rise once again as a sign PERCUS
