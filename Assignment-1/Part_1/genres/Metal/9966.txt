Lyrics Angela Gossow Michael Amott Born with eyes But they are not to see Living on your knees Choking on spiritual agony Follow the traces of blood Throughout the past centuries You choose not to see Bow down and worship me at the alter of shame You strive for perfection but you don't have the tools Human weakness embodied Fodder to fools Feeding the fear of life it self Over and over again And you choose not to see Bow down and worship me at the alter of shame So you're the saint and I'm the sinner You will never understand You're the saint and I'm the sinner No you will never understand Harmony Michael and Christopher Amott 1st Lead Michael Amott 2nd Lead Christopher Amott 3rd Lead Michael Amott 4th Lead Christopher Amott Born with eyes But they are not to see Living on your knees Choking in agony Follow the traces of blood Throughout the past centuries Still you choose not to see Bow down and worship me at the alter of shame Outro melody Christopher Amott
