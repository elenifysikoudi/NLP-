Music Lyrics by Lord Ahriman Blackmoon Oh mighty lord of the evil realm Open the gates to your dominion Save me from this holy light That makes me suffer like a pig Satan lead me to your throne And make me one with hell I kneel before you dark lord And swear the unholy oath Unholy master Satan make my wish come true Open wide your kingdom where all the evil rule Lord of hell possess my soul With thousand mad and insane demons Lock up the seven gates And bring out your infernal legions Lucifer lead me to your throne Satan bless my damned soul Belial baptize me in blood Leviathan take me to the depths Open the gates Satan Open the gates Satan Open the gates Satan Open the gates Satan Master cast your spell on earth Curse the waek disciples their holy soul must burn Lord of fire consume the holy lord Your black flame of damnation shall purify the world Lucifer let the cursed soul burn Satan make fire consume the world Belial sacrifice thy holy blood Leviathan show their lord your wrath Open the gates Satan Open the gates Satan Open the gates Satan Open the gates Satan
