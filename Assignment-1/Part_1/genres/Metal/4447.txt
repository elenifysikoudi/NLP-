"One by one eye for an eye our modified and improved version of the divine judgment Feeding our hatred through the years now your blood will be our nirvana your death will be our rebirth ""Carry on slay them all Unleash the barbarian within and impose your ethics Go ahead and shatter all their hopes "" [Step back and see behold your creation You call this victory You still proudly wear the ribbon of shame ] The cities burn and so does our vainglory "
