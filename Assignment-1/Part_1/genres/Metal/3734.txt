Once great King of Buzzard and cobra who once ruled over the land your existence has but ceased and time is no longer a demand Ritual Journey has begun and now no time is left Sky is Dark Pyramid points north Now the eternal quest Jackal God of Embalming Anubis takes his toll one by one it is all removed heart liver and soul Mind is next by breaking bones between cavity and skull with a hook the brain comes out by careful and few pulls Painted eyes of stone are placed in the head For this of you life is what you were bed Incission in the gut organs are withdrawn corpse is stuffed and wrapped for lifetimes to come Inovaters of the ancient kind Perplexities that can never be placed in line Ahhh Into the world of shadows the soul soon shall find Whether the heart is heavy or whether it lies The life will be destroyed if htis is so and the judgment shall be passed to the underworld below Oooh devour the light oooh devour the cries oooh devour the light oooh devour the cries
