open wide now that my body is pill sized rode this wind like a zeppelin did are you truly surprised babe i looked you over i picked your cover over my lover didn't want to understand i'm in the business of zoning your acrobats are groaning your salty words flew over my shoulder everybody wants what they can't have i want everything he reminds me of the day i turned you in everybody wants what they can't have i want everything everything i took a turn i know i'm sorry i took a turn with just a wrinkle my heart is a burden the moonlight is simple we'll darn all the curtains bittersweet needle in the bone tell me all your favorite words and in the summer you'll be gone oh i moved too soon stems and leaves thrown on the sidewalk i would say that i was a gardener but regret is a personal fault regret is a personal fault regret is a personal fault regret is a personal fault with just a wrinkle my heart is a burden the moonlight is simple we'll darn all the curtains
