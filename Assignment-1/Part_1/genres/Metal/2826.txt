The silence of evening I'm embraced by its cold On the bloodred path I walk Into darkest eternity From no time place or time I came Across the friends of my dreams Through the dreaming glade I've walked Somewhere in forests of sleep The silence of evening I'm awake still I dream I've walked down the shores of time In the shadows of sin In a time of tears it comes To burn the fields of my dreams I've seen the signs by the shores of time The last of dawns are to come I've seen the signs by the shores of time burning damnation Now I walk alone through the gates of sin without repention The silence of evening Still I wait for the dawn On my trail of tears I walk In a time of tears it comes To burn the fields of my dreams I've seen the signs by the shores of time The last of dawns is to come
