I slide around on silver wings I long for air as I strive for solid grounds This space I have coloured with life and faith These smiles and tears Ive gathered from joy and rage Hear the rain Fear the shame I feel the pain See the rain Am I insane Am I to blame I feel my thoughts go everywhere Hung up on walls Tuning in and fading out This space Ive coloured with life and faith These smiles and tears Ive gathered from joy and rage I see you tried To say goodbye I just sighed You denied To save your pride You just lied I hear your voice calling I see your faith falling This space Ive coloured with life and pain These tears and smiles Ive gathered from joy and rain
