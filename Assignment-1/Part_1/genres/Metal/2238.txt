Suffering sacred of me is big and stark Defeat is what I mean No one can understands m why Why I'm a gambler Isolated in mind Isolated in mind Why I obey myself in a moment of weakness against my own will why Psychotic fear that surrounds me Who am I Be careful of me and my dreams All or nothing After all destroying what I've earned I prefer mow and tomorrow Wright or wrong just going my own way and saying good bye No fear just growth just growth No one understands me why Isolated in mind All or nothing
