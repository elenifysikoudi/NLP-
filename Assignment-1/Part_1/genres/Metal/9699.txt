Hooray let's go All gods of iron must suffer corrosion There is but one truth so no pairs can thrive Fear of damnation preserve what is pure Mom dad implosion They are a couple so which one must die Under his eyes under the Shadow of the gods of reason Under his wings he looks all Flowers but he's reared by owls My hands can't say Which is the owl and which is of god Black wings red lead Paint my arm they must know there's but one Formaldehyde bath All gods of flesh do smell in the dogdays Their flesh is one I can't meet their eyes Fear of damnation preserves the deformed Breaks don't move We hunt like rats but we die as mice Under his eyes under the Shadow of the gods of reason Under his wings he looks all Flowers but he's reared by owls Close eye Paint it black they must know there's but one Don't sleep When darkness comes he splits them and hunt Under his eyes under the Shadow of the gods of reason Under his wings he looks all Flowers but he's reared by owls And in my ears the consonants of Death crushing all objections And in my claws the lost faith Coming home
