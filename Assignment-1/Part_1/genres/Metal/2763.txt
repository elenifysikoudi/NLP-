One day on the block I was speaking to a close partner A black Caddie rolled up I shot ya I felt my soul reach back through times With my youth was cold and gritty On the south side of the city Read the sign it says Town of no pity' First grade was vague Eighth grade bounce to the east side From Negros to essays Scuffle from Sunday through Saturdays In alley ways shady ways When my Mom wasn't lookin' A midnight marauder life was part of Me dippin out the window of your daughter Days come and gone define who we are There I am at age 19 a ghetto super star Bang bang Angel of death came to claim Bang bang Holding a bullet with my name Bang bang Life is over too late to change I'm walking with shadows To the Valley of Death come on Yeah I'm a dead man walking out Yeah too late to change So many escapades led me astray Look there goes the time I first held an A K Aimed at your way itchy finger Lookin to turn y'all to dead weight No role model living life at full throttle Mind gone doing wrong passin out with a 40 bottle And I tell ya I kept trippin as my soul kept drifting through death I'm remenising my life of non fiction Globe still spinning witnessing what I'm missin' And that made me yearn addiction to money weed and bitches Game brought me the riches sabotage from snitches This is just a chronicle of days come and gone now Bang bang Angel of death came to claim Bang bang Holding a bullet with my name Bang bang Life is over too late to change I'm walking with shadows To the Valley of Death Bang bang Angel of death came to claim Bang bang Holding a bullet with my name Bang bang Life is over too late to change I'm walking with shadows To the Valley of Death come on Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge I'm trying not to lose my head Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge I'm trying not to lose my head Bang bang Angel of death came to claim Bang bang Holding a bullet with my name Bang bang Life is over too late to change I'm walking with shadows To the Valley of Death Bang bang Angel of death came to claim Bang bang Holding a bullet with my name Bang bang Life is over too late to change I'm walking with shadows To the Valley of Death
