In pursuit of Clarividence to live is to sleep To die is to awake in the twilight of the fears Those countless melodies of hate In the oceans of fresh sadness The sound of the other side Is the mirror of my grave's face But I have pride and force My heart is the fire of hope The anger will make me Immortal For me to die is to awake Ecstasy in the nocturnal winds Light and visions of grey faces Vortex of innocence and desire No beauty nor happiness Vortex of innocence and desire Show me the memories Honoris lux infinitus I want to be forsaken under my forgotten lands Hear the whispers of the moon Forever my will is strong and my hate is everlasting My bride is the majesty she comes in the Honoris lux infinitus Light and visions of grey faces No beauty nor happiness
