We will sail on forever on To the land of the evening star Into the endless we ride Unveil the darkness behind Abandoned glory hidden castaway we ride Now will the sky surrender Forever through the never A silent whisper echoes through my restless heart tonight And I will see the glory rise We'll be one tonight Don't you shut your eyes in silence Tonight gather near come and live your fear In a land of desire your heart filled with fire You live for the right to be free We will sail on forever on To the land of the evening star In a land of desire your heart filled with fire The land of the evening star Now and forever after Asylums filled with laughter Suspicion haunts my dreams An echo through my mind This starlit gaze reminds me Are you so blind you can't see The winds of change my friend Will blow for you in the dead of night And I will see glory rise We'll be one tonight Don't you shut your eyes in silence Tonight gather near come and live your fear In a land of desire your heart filled with fire You live for the right to be free We will sail on forever on To the land of the evening star In a land of desire your heart filled with fire The land of the evening star In a land of desire your heart filled with fire You live for the right to be free We will sail on forever on To the land of the evening star In a land of desire your heart filled with fire The land of the evening star In a land of desire your heart filled with fire The land of the evening star
