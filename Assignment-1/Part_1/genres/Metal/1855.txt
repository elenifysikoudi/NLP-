I hear voices coming out of my head They are my destiny and your dead end I'm closed into my body suggest me hate Souls tied together lost their faith Voices loud so loud Rat bones in my mind Voices Can't drive them back Rat bones Deadly blood compact Rat bones Under my skin Rat bones They kill my dream Rat bones Under my skin Rat bones It's time to kill I've dig that bones out for a long time They're inside me here in my mind Crushed splints opened my veins Affect me and cause me so much pain
