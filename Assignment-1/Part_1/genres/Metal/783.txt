Standing here right in front of me A Ghost from my memories It's plain to see but I don't believe It's wrong I know I know How can I believe When all my life it seems The truth has been always kept from me Although I do feel strong Never will I trust the lies that they spew All of my hopes and dreams will come true Some say forever more But I don't have time at all Some try to even the score But I just don't know what for Some lie when they say goodbye They'd rather live in denial Some die to be reborn But I'd rather not conform Fate you see plays a game with me It tears me up inside It frightens me to the core of me And never lets me go How can I retrieve What I thought was meant for me When all of my life it seems The truth has kept me strong Never will I trust the lies that they spew All of my hopes and dreams will come true Some say forever more But I don't have time at all Some try to even the score But I just don't know what for Some lie when they say goodbye They'd rather live in denial Some die to be reborn But I'd rather not conform Destiny and reality Manifest eternity It's plain to see right in front of me Where it was all along Never will I trust the lies that they spew All of my hopes and dreams will come true Some say Some try Some lie Some die Some die
