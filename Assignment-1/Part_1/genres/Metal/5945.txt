Its time to leave this eerie sound I cared but failed the ones I love I guess its just what comes around We try to bend but then it breaks What kind of mind makes these odd shakes I can't believe it ends all here You pull me down You always failed You pull me down I fake a laugh I sway You broke my heart I fell so hard always Because of you Im still afraid today Its time to leave this eerie sound I cared but failed the ones I love I guess its just what comes around You pull me down You pull me down I fake a laugh I sway You broke my heart I fell so hard always Because of you Im still afraid today Because of you Im still afraid today I will not give you what you think that you earn from me I will not make the same mistakes you always made I tried to show you that I cared although you always failed I was too young to have known better better than you You could have kept all those stories to your self I tried to show you that I cared although you always failed I was too young to have known better better than you
