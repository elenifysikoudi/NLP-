I am the snake redirected The left hand path paved with grace I am the lifeless that sheds its skin Swallowing myself in completion of the total self The endless round of existence Crushing all destiny of hope Completion within isolation Hell divine through six blind eyes Blank face of the transformed Breaching this cross you bear The black stares down Beholding the greatest slain A first step out of this old age A trial of lies once where wings soared Sits scars of a fallen icon Torn from this back of freedom We all descend to the lower world Rise Changed Venom of rebirth to engulf all Burial head down Inversion of punishment Expulsion to the sea of disloyalty To never see again Entwined inside Chaos consumed This future of undying Rise of the uncrucified As the serpent climbs the cross of shame An unbound virus of agnostic rage Tainted skin with a touch of the perverse Cast away fron an unjust form of freedom Transformation of the snake A new oblivion of blasphemy She dding the skin of what used to be This war waged as all the horns of Jericho begin The death of all your deities Suspended from grace Worship a raised profit of nothing Filtering of the insane Perpetual feeding of this seed of chaos Embracing this revelation of entire dusk Fuse this self attained consuming of worship Milking the fated in resurrection for triumph
