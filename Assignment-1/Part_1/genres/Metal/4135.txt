"Apo pantos kakodaimonos Apo pantos kakodaimonos We transgress the context of commonplaceness We deny normality trample morality We destroy angels with sound We destroy angels with silence Currents of tantric anarchy seize our bodies Into the cosmic dance of four scythes The curtains of absurd theater are raised Synchronicity mother chaos on the stage Wisdom says ""Be strong"" Thrilling words are spreading down the spine Vibrating be strong Exhausted I'm running towards the last shines of consciousness Which is absorbed by shadows of madness Apo pantos kakodaimonos Apo pantos kakodaimonos Here are the star and the snake servants they rise the hexagram Sun in the triangle hidden sight sacred visions entwined And union with nothingness body I'll find Strength go along the Mars path fighting if we must Light oh you are Ahathoor goddess of blue sky There is might of dawn in non quality state I remain Of commonness crippled time or sand glass you don't see again Sigillum dei picture of myself I'm drawing with life Venom and hell I'm sprinkling it his name is Esial I want him more"
