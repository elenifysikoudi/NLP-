Hey What time is it Chi Chico What time is it Sometimes it feels so good I can't feel its so bad My inner clock is tickin' And the black beat drives me mad It's erotic exotic hypnotic that's for sure Put a smile on your face To take you to a place you've never been before Get up Let it all hang out Jump back You wanna scream and shout Don't you wanna get out of line Ev'rybody say what time is it What time is it It's Chico Time Well You can get delirious If you take life too serious It's Chico Time Now get up in this song You can't do nothin wrong In front of the mirror like there's a party going on If you want it you got it go get it Baby can't you see Don't fantasize just realize Be happy to be free Get up Let it all hang out Jump back You wanna scream and shout Don't you wanna get out of line Ev'rybody say what time is it What time is it It's Chico Time Well You can get delirious If you take life too serious Shake it lawdy Come on baby funk my body Do it good and do it naughty If you don't dig reality then Baby just lay it on me It's Chico Time Go Chico Go Chico Go Go Chico Go Chico Go Repeat Hand in the air let me see you clap you're hands Let me hear you all you Chicettes All you Chicos You can get delirious If you take life too serious You can get delirious If you take life too serious It's Chico Time
