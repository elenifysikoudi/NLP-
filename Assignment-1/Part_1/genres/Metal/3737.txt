Ahhhh Hydra The serpentine Immortal so it seems Slain it cannot be Soon I shall see In the shadows I go into its home In the shadows I know it waits alone In the shadows I fan my feelings of hate Nine heads staring at me eighteen eyes that can see No fear in my soul this beast I control Battle raising fierce off with one head and two appear what can be done to pass this labor the second one In the depths of this hell lerna calls me out snake marshes its bed soon it s home will run red Blood falling like rain its life will I drain Burn the severed limbs none will appear again
