Keep your eye focused this time keep us in front of your sights I've waited long for this Now it's the time for bliss I just hope we have the time I stand broken please god hear my cries he does every time How many times have you watched me fall just to smile I've been through thick and thin we've struggled through now we smile So we're here now just be ready brace yourself cause were not leaving Keep your eye focused this time Keep us in front of your sights I've waited long for this our time to shine I just hope we have the time I stand broken please god hear my cries he does every time Help us get out help us get out out into the open Help us grow rise up rise up Help us grow rise up rise up Help us grow rise up rise up Help us grow rise up rise up I stand broken please god hear my cries He does every time He does every time Keep your eye focused this time Keep us in front of your sights I've waited long for this now it's the time for bliss I just hope we have the time I stand broken please god hear my cries he does every time
