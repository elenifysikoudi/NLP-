In a lifetime of decay Sudden cry for yesterday When the world will see the end of eternity Sacrifice before the dawn Of a child soon to be born Before the night too many tears we cried In a long forgotten land Through the silent raging pain Of the price to pay that awaits for me The end of all our destiny Don't close your eyes tonight For the lights beyond still shine towards a brighter day The time has come for us tread blood across the sands Carry on as the red rivers run And through the wilderness we feel the pouring rain In the silence ever searching on through the misery And all the promises we made and cried in vain Don't you take the time to realise the master of disguise Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away Out of the dark pain is the price Fly away out of the raging storm Lost within my memories Still haunting me A never ending story Far and wide forever on Stand before the world alone we journey to the other side Raise your hands to the sky Through the night and through the day Don't look back no time to pray The battle rages on marching on and on Don't cry for me tonight For the lights beyond will guide me home tomorrow The time will come for us the curse is growing strong Carry on with the rise of the sun So take me far away it's time to set me free All my life I have been waiting but I could never see Raising your hands to the sky Turning your eyes to the sun Pray for forgiveness The power to save has gone for the last time Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away Out of the dark pain is the price Fly away out of the raging storm Lost within my memories Still haunting me A never ending story Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away Out of the dark pain is the price Fly away out of the raging storm Lost within my memories Still haunting me A never ending story
