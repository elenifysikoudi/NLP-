Tonight is gone They tell you it's your time But I won't let them take you from me And I'll never get far from you I'll never get far from you We all feel the same Can't stop this suffering in my head Can't turn this one around If I could pull you from wreckage We'd be all fine oh lord Don't tell me this is happening If I could hold you for a second We'd be all right oh lord Don't tell me this is happening So when does it start getting better So far from home The lights are fading out Just leave us all behind If I could pull you from wreckage We'd be all fine oh lord Don't tell me this is happening If I could hold you for a second We'd be all right oh lord Don't tell me this is happening Ohhhh I never should have let you go Until I'll be with you I'm dying on my own If I could pull you from wreckage We'd be all fine oh lord Don't tell me this is happening If I could hold you for a second We'd be all right oh lord Don't tell me this is happening And I know I'm not the only one Don't tell me this is happening And I know I'm not the only one Don't tell me this is happening Don't tell me this is happening
