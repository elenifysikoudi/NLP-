Daylight dreams so coloured lose their way under Ego skies while sleepless I'm starting to realise the reasons leading your life You come and keep on coming just for yourself with frozen lips that are cheating my face so keep on faking love while instead your warmless kiss is beginning to fade inner screams take over unbounded in empty nights while echoes of past lives are calling to reasons lost in my eyes Your senseless kiss is juts fooling yourself swallow my life but beware the poison running inside since love is poison for those who lie and for those who cannot cry
