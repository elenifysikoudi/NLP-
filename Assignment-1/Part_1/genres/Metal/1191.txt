"Siri I'm drunk Isn't that a little early for that All hype It's friday night And the weather is good My mates are on the way I'm stoked because Tonight we're getting Fucking loose Dressed to kill Walk out the front door My mum and dad yell ""Don't be home later than four"" Sorry guys I've busted my ass At work all week And I deserve more than a few drinks It's time to rage Just fill up a cup Kiss the nearest person Just don't give a fuck Live a little Scream out your lungs Go hard or go home Don't be A bitch cunt Don't think of tomorrow think of tomorrow We're living for now So rage all night Let's go to hell on this town Staing up late that's right All hype all night Staing up late that's right All hype all night Drop a molly climb a roof Preatand to fly Tonight will be the wildest night of my life Pop a bottle smoke a blow to this This is every night we're young This is the way we live Walk into the party There's not a soul to be seen Fuck I been pumped for this shit all week Bung as I'm losing sight I close my eyes without a care Open them and there's people everywhere Don't think of tomorrow think of tomorrow We're living for now So rage all night Let's go to hell on this town Staing up late that's right All hype all night Staing up late that's right All hype all night Here's to you you're true blue You're a piss pot through and through You're a bastard so they say You tried to go to heaven But you went the other way you went down Down down down down down down down Down down down down You tried to go to heaven But you went the other way so get down Down down down down All hype all night all night all night all night Oi you've got to fucking fight for your right to party I'm not fighting for shit"
