Innocent deformed child Concepted by my lies Born by my isolation Its suffering is my creation Piece of me I love its embrace But I'll never know its face It hurts I'm the one to blame I want you to feel my pain I'm your blood I can feel I'm your blood I'm your fear I'm your blood I'm your pain I'm your blood We're the same Time sweeps my tears away Quiet words yes they show my way Their whisper strokes me I see my victim's body My knife runs into it again Pleasure kills till the end Flash on my blade my kind of art I'm in my hell and I won't get out
