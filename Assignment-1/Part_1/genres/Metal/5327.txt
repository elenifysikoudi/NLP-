Falling gradually endlessly the perfect disease Everyone's a winner but you're down on your knees Sanity is passing one more shot if you please For the one final game I won't be playing Still the same tempting voice in my mind Losing grip on it all losing grip on it all Carry on through the endless lies 'Cause I can't see a reason why Give me the night Let me be me for one last time A prisoner of myself lost in disguise Just give me the night Still living in a twisted dream There's no tomorrow for right now will be The best time of my life Hammering sickening torment and pain Blind ambition to poison my brain Cheating lying begging stealing day after day For the one final dose I won't be saving Pure darkness consuming my life Don't wanna die here alone die here alone Walk away from reality Got a date with the enemy The best time of my life Still the same tempting voice in my mind Losing grip on it all losing grip on it all Carry on through the endless lies 'Cause I can't see a reason why Yeah
