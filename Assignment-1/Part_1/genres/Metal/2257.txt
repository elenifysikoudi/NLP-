shine shine I'm so depressed I'm so alone with my own thoughts they never been told it's like a tunnel no light sorrounds me I loose my aim and I'm in grief shine shine my time will come then I'll shine I'm looking back subjected life until it's true I must be strong I've to stand tall without a doubt am I blind no I'll shine I'll shine I will shine shine shine shine it's just one step it's just one thought keeps me alive to carry on it's not for you only for me it's like a wonder and now I'm in love am I blind no I'll shine I'll shine I will shine shine that was my story of bitterness and no glory now see me shine now see me shine
