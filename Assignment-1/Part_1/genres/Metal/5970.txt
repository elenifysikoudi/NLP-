As the sand spreads wide open and the glow of the sun pearls the skin All hope is craving fluids and the yearning to where we've been Golden grounds so absorbing When the heat of the sun boils the skin We have to stand the test of nature to return to where we've been Hold on my saviour Keep my heart in holy dimensions Drag me on your back for one more day One more day One more day You give You learn You live You learn I guess what ever you may find It's all right to eat a piece of your mind
