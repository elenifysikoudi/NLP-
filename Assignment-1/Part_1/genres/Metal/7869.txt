Diabolis Interium I wander along the path of darkness Heart so cold skin so pale Driven forth by the question My answers are written in blood Sweet Christian blood You can't escape my wrath For I am one of the lords I am the keeper of your pain I am the holder of the spear Like a serpent I'm slithering In a maze of sin and filth Look down you so called god Step down from your heavenly throne Let your divine tears of blood rain over us And behold what I do to your servants And behold what I do to your servants I am a demon that dwells in the darkest flame The evil from inside I am a demon king of the darkest realm For I am Satan Diabolis Interium Diabolis Interium You can't escape my wrath For I am one of the lords I am the keeper of the key to the cosmic pain I am the holder of the spear Like a serpent I'm slithering Through your world divine Diabolis Interium Diabolis Interium
