These gardens of angst In which I stand Lost and confused Hungry for more Eager to cross This river of tears Safe in this void In which I live Free from despair Weaving a web Surrounding my soul Imprisoned distress In a world of dying angels Trespassers on unknown domains Traumatic defeat This time I'll burn For one thousand years Bearing the truth Deep down inside It dies with me Taste the pure salt Of misery Hell's ecstasy Feel destiny Breathe in your neck Cut you so deep Twisting my mind Living in sin Dying within Wicked and mean Sinister eyes Staring at me
