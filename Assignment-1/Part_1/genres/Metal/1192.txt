Where do I begin I didn't know that I need your approval To do something that would never include you Talk is cheap you want to know what I think Go back to your bedroom with your goddamn keyboard My future I see more you losers should just redraw Shooting blanks in the dark drop it Low What is this fucking for Are you trying to justify You are no better than your words here as a waste for the world My dreams are higher than the fucking sky I'm going to keep at this I'll do this till I die You talk it I live it you're jealous I admit it You're not going to break my stride Do I have to bury myself to be unnoticed I'll hide there until I grab you and pull you under I will end you Let me be let me be My dreams are higher than the fucking sky I'm going to keep at this I'll do this till I die You talk it I live it you're jealous I admit it You're not going to break my stride You say that shit to me and I don't give a fuck Say it to my face I'll end you There's always room for change as long as your prepared To pay for your mistakes empty your head You keep on running at least I got something To end my life with where do you go now You keep on running at least I got something To end my life with what do you amount to You keep on running at least I got something To end my life with where do you go now You keep on running at least I got something To end my life with what do you amount to
