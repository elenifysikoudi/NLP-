Feed your weakness Grasp like me I've done it I understood How one can act To kill to be free Kill to be free kill to be free Long enough I couldn't see the matter Say Now here I stop No more from now on No commands yes and amen it's over Now I see no more demons around about me and No weird thoughts cause I'm the one who kill Kill to be free Kill to be free kill to be free Second half I'll be back and I'm coming I'll grow steady to be stark To release my new world Now I see No more demons around about me and No weird thoughts cause I'm the one who kill Assassinate the scars Now I see No more demons around about me and No weird thoughts cause I'm the one who kill Assassinate the scars Assassinate the scars
