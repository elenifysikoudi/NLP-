"Sometimes it would be fine to turn back time It's about the years I spent with coming in line Searching the way the so called ""straightforward"" path Now I know I'm down to earth and I will fuck you up You make my blood boil with your stupid games that you play I might seem to be tame but it's all the same I know who's to blame Don't say a world about trust I don't want to know With your lies you shut yourself out of the room of hope You filled my life with pain I take care of your death I will kill you two times And you will never find rest First I kill your soul Then I suck your blood out Your body will serve me You'll keep my dreams alive You don't know these eyes staring at you right now You feel my hate and your fear reflects on my insane mind My revenge feeds my demon inside His power comes from the deep cold night"
