"Take cover run for your life Cause I'd rather die than let you get away Get away from me Run take cover and save yourself It's ok you'll be going under Fall to your knees is what you told to me How can I believe When you live a lie Lie to my face it's nothing new to me This is going too far You let them in on your secrets And they're not following not following Now the best part is over I hope you savored the taste You think you'll save us with your false impressions You think it's working but you won't change me Fall to your knees is what you told me How can I believe When you live a lie Lie to my face it's nothing new to me Fall to your knees Fall to your knees Lie to my face it's nothing new to me Your time is running out You should have known better Only you can save you now But you won't remember Your time is running out You should have known better Only you can save you now But you won't remember Your time is running out You should have known better Only you can save you now But you won't remember But you won't remember You should have known better So who's going to save you now ""Girl hey Beau you are a fucking liar You are worthless I never want to ever talk to you or see you again So go fuck yourself fuck you"""
