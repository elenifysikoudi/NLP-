Music by Nergal lyrics by Nergal Since a long time I've visited those old dungeons I spilled the first blood in the depth In the darkness of the forest's maze I found her morbid beauty I used to spend whole days In the mystic places of Delduwath There where the light of the fullmoon Fell as the dying sun The wolf's howling was lulling to sleep My young soul How beautiful were the views of nocturnal land How wonderful was the life in complete solitude Away from villages and towns mentions and palaces The last moments give birth to memories in me Who was that beauty majestic and great What were those views beautiful gilded by leaves Which were hiding behind them so many mystic wefts They stole my solitude and independence I lie crushed by the chains in a wet cell bleeding I am waiting for mother the last hope death Let the died out fire awake in me let it awake Aldaron
