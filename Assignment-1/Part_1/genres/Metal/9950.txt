Hideous crimes an atrocities The slaughter of millions beyond belief Those were dark times so different from now The law of evil ruled our fatherland I was but a pawn in their game Why should I feel any guilt Still when I close close my eyes The words unfold it all comes back I can't defy it can't deny it I know it to be true In my sleep they come to haunt me They know it to be true Tears of the dead We are all on the turning wheel of fate A young man standing proud in uniform I never stopped to hesitate Until it was far too late I was but a pawn in their game Why should I feel any guilt Still when I close close my eyes The words unfold it all comes back I can't defy it can't deny it I know it to be true In my sleep they come to haunt me They know it to be true Tears of the dead My hands are soiled covered in blood Stains that never wash away Their hollow eyes confronting me Judging me Now an old man at the end of my days Contemplating my life of sin Living is never simple the road is hard I had no say just a puppet in a sick play I was but a pawn in their game Why should I feel any guilt Still when I close close my eyes The words unfold it all comes back I can't defy it can't deny it I know it to be true In my sleep they come to haunt me They know it to be true Tears of the dead Tears of the dead Tears of the dead Tears of the dead Tears of the dead Tears of the dead Tears of the dead Tears of the dead Tears of the dead
