Vessels sink men go under I don't wanna die it feels like cancer A bridge collapse a train that flies I'm scared of the screams that fill the skies You're not gonna die he says he lies Feel hell underfeet I feel how it fries Second by second I sink underneath Second by second I sink underneath It wears me down It Wears Me Down All of me all of me all of me down Woods swallowing men with cold dark beasts and deep blue skies Quaking earth winds that wipe creations of man away like dust I reach out to fathom all of my kin I have none that is sin Alone we die like cattle in storm Alone we die like cattle in storm It Wears Me Down It wears me down It wears me down All of me all of me all of me down
