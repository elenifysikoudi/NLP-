Watch the skies as hell comes riding in On a horse of pale to name this wrath Torturing worthless souls as this reign begins This hand of doom is set to rule the world A wilted faith in these times of regret Sculpting death in madness obsessed Words of this mayhem cast out loud A timeless torture foretold in a sky of black Torn souls from the mold of flesh and bone Hordes of plague in this path of all decay Obliterate the screams of the weak Who needs a God when you've got Satan No God to offer this forgiveness No God to punish for these sins Tormented for the prize of salvation Broken loyalty to life after death These dark thoughts of this revival Answered by the prayers of this carnage Confusion caused in the spread of horror The answer to your nightmares has just begun Forgotten praise of a savior from the rapture beyond the clouds A burning fear of the wrongs that the slave has chosen Cleansed in flame purified through ash These burning rites of the vengeful The head of three faces severed in confession Ritual abuse to swarm the insects of famine Endless weight of sufferance closing the source of breath Battle call for the rise of genocide for the righteous believers Unholy force to be summoned by the screams of slaughter The wicked tongue of plague calling forth the death of God
