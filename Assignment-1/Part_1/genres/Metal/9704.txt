Who opened the door for the democrator And how come he let in the market conquistadors Why is he acting as if he has something to hide The privilege of the stupid is to be taken for a ride Gloomy working days bright TV nights There's a world ahead we can also see it's lights And the road there starts on the other side Of the screen where life's endless Mercedes rides Who opened the door for the democrator And how come he let in the market conquistadors Why is he acting as if he has something to hide The privilege of the stupid is to be taken for a ride So we smashed the screen but it all went black We tore down that wall and we all sacked The fruits of KDW we were small to reach The only thing we got was freedom of speech Who opened the door for the democrator And how come he let in the market conquistadors Why is he acting as if he has something to hide The privilege of the stupid is to be taken for a ride Happy ever after in Deutschneyland Happy ever after in Deutschneyland Happy ever after in Deutschneyland
