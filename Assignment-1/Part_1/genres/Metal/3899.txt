If I could know the way this ends I'd then understand I'll live What it is to be made from the best of you Let my hands make movement for hearts of the tested few If I could know the way The way this ends I'd then understand wa oh wa ah oh If I could know the way wa oh wa ah oh I'd see the glory in these hands I'm placing stone upon stone But this castle is falling faster than my hands They gained the west wall Fall back to the stables Prepare for the last stand I end here you start now Like iron sharpens iron I will make you better You will make me my best Like sea salt to my skin to my skin Without you I am but a tasteless man If I could know the way The way this ends I'd then understand wa oh wa ah oh If I could know the way wa oh wa ah oh I'd see the glory in these hands This is end this is end This armor weighs but I will fight till I face the sky If I could know the way wa oh wa ah oh If I could know the way The way this ends I'd then understand wa oh wa ah oh If I could know the way wa oh wa ah oh I'd see the glory in this
