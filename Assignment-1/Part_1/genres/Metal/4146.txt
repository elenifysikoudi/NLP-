Above the high temple ov matter Svastikas ov time slash the heaven And from the pit from the slime From the thought Gliphotic intruder decays Lilith Thantilaxath Zi'uaq Non manifestation born in the dark ov a day Can you hear distant desert call And stone you see by Adytum builders rejected damned Deeper deeper in the night world fear Towards the noctuary ov the truth From the mirror we crawls out Devouring Eden's light In the tunnels ov Seth he abides Shugal The Howler Who am I Where I'm going Where We live dreaming Slipping from body to body And nightmares still our breath And his in our souls Poisoning with the venom ov existence
