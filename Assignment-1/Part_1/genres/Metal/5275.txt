The wind calls your name forever blowing away days together I'm only a child butt I feel like I will die tomorrow Something's wrong with me I see you every where and all the things you said to me now are burning in my head When I walk so lonely our pleasure is only a dream I can't think about you anymore I think all my life's been wasted We are in different plains the sky is turning red I'm always on the road and I don't know the city where I'll stay something's wrong Through time nd space you are in me girl you are always in my dreams of love peace and joy We touch our seventh heaven but nothing lasts forever maybe you'll fly free someday Can't live without love My life's been wasted now you've got the chance to change your life Stormy weather I can't find any place to go My eyes can't see you but it seems like you are everywhere
