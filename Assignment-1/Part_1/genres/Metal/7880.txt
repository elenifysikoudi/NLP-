Lighting storms Descend across the sky Arrival of the horned The coming of our lord Lucifer Thy legions are set free Demon hordes Awaiting his return Dark age Kingdoms lost in shadows Fallen empires Cursed by unholy lord Abominations Buried into ashes Ancient realms forlorn Into eternal darkness Damned domains in darkness Eclipse of land forlorn Ruins of a kingdom gone Once ruled by god When angels forever die When Satan has arrived When Satan rules the world for eternity Lighting storms Descend across the sky Arrival of the horned The coming of our lord Lucifer Thy legions are set free Demon hordes Awaiting his return Storms of damnation Caress the mourning sky Demon hordes from realms below Show the mighty force of hell When angels forever die When Satan has arrived When Satan rules the world for eternity
