I am stuck here with a torn up soul that can never Be mended you you destroyed my dreams i i sat Silently never knowing how much you stole and how I suffered never knowing incapable of love Your smile your deep brown eyes your skin so soft And dark as night your actions made me who i am Today i stand here half a man convincing brown eyes As dark as night why did you stray from the den and Take away all my pride deceitful brown eyes as dark As night i was blinded by your beauty your smile Your deep brown eyes heart so cold and black as night I will never forget you this pain will never leave my Memories of you of you as for your love it was Never there all of this pain I set ablaze
