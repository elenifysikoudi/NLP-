This liquid vision of euphoria Living a life on borrowed time Paying the price of immortality Desperately avoiding our fate Lead me through the halls of tortured souls Alone forlorn human dignity dethroned Forevermore A life never ending Time stands still as the immortals keep on breeding The future is locked within us All we need is the key Crying at the fountain of youth Eternal life is killing me Triumphant in chariots they ride On this arena of the undead Another lap of honor for the Vacant galleries
