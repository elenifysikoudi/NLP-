I let go of the world I let go of the light Then I fell towards memories of the dead To the blackness I fell I was lost I was scared And alone with the memories of the dead Every single step I fear to take No light at all and no end in sight I must find my way I must find my way Now that I'm living here And there's nowhere to go Speaking to me are memories of the dead How to cope and endure And survive all of this I must listen to memories of the dead In this place I must control my fear By myself I must learn to be comfortable in darkness To be comfortable in darkness Is this darkness within and is life just the one Is all of this in my head If it is I can choose What I think what I feel These things I fear are only real in my head Now I found the choices I can make I choose to rule my fear and not to break I will master my own darkness There is no step that I now fear to take The world within me is mine to create My fate is in my own hands Now I understand How it can be how I can see how I can find a way To be comfortable in darkness To be comfortable in darkness Victory of myself by myself over me To be comfortable in darkness In darkness
