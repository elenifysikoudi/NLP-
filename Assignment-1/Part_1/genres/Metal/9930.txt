I am forced to creep down the path Of my sad and senseless life Darkness surrounds me At the end of the tunnel there is no light A blackened void nothingness Lament of a mortal soul Who am I Only dust in the blowing wind Am I dying My name dies slowly Echoes into eternal oblivion Replaced by others castly forgotten I hate my empty existence
