I wish I could believe you Then I'll be alright But now ev'rything you told me Really don't apply To the way I feel inside Lovin you was easy once upon a time But now my suspicions of you have multiplied And it's all because you lied I only give you a hard time 'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this But I'm much too full of resentment Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me Don't know how you gave another Who didn't mean a thing no The very thing you gave to me I thought I could forgive you And I know you've changed As much as I wanna trust you I know it ain't the same And it's all because you lied I only give you a hard time 'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this But I'm much too full of resentment I may never understand why I'm doing the best that I can and I I tried and I tried to forgive this But I'm much too full of resentment I'll always remember feelin' Like I was no good Like I couldn't do it for you Like your mistress could And it's all because you lied Loved you more than ever More than my own life The best part of me I gave you It was sacrificed And it's all because you lied I only give you a hard time 'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I tried and I tried to forgive this But I'm damn too full of resentment I know she was attractive But I was here first Been ridin with you for six years Why did I deserve To be treated this way by you you I know you're prob'ly thinkin' What's up with B I've been cryin for too long What did you do to me I used to be so strong But now you took my soul I'm cryin can't stop cryin' Can't stop cryin' You could've told me that you wasn't happy I know you didn't wanna hurt me Look what you've done to me now I gotta look at her in her eyes And see she's had half of me How could you lie You lied
