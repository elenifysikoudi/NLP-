Some children see him Some children see him lily white The baby jesus born this night Some children see him lily white With tresses soft and fair Some children see him bronzed and brown The lord of heav'n to earth come down Some children see him bronzed and brown With dark and heavy hair Some children see him almond eyed This savior whom we kneel beside Some children see him almond eyed With skin of yellow hue Some children see him dark as they Sweet mary's son to whom we pray Some children see him dark as they And ah they love him too The children in each diff'rent place Will see the baby jesus face Like theirs but bright with heav'nly grace And filled with holy light O lay aside each earthly thing And with thy heart as offering Come worship now the infant king 'tis love that's born tonight
