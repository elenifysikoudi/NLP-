Tumbling curls of green by the stainedglass streaming light And a yellow coloured lampshade used to keep us up all night The smile upon your face the tears upon your cheek And the night sky on the window Your heart calling out to me Come running home again Katie Come running home again Cross my heart and hope to die Shall I cause another tear from your eye The mirror that won't talk and your nightgown on the door And the old pedal Singer just don't sing no more You can roll the reels for hours From the movie of this book It's a question mark on this heart of mine Sends an elder back to look Come running home again Katie Come running home again Cross my heart and hope to die Shall I cause another tear from your eye
