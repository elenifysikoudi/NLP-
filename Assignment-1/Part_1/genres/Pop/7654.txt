Don't worry this face Hold my hand in error Don't tell of this place It's for me and you only Softly softly know me Don't worry this face Hold my hand in error Don't tell of this place It's for me and you only You give me love you know you give me love With your ultraviolet rays You give me love You give me love Ultraviolet
