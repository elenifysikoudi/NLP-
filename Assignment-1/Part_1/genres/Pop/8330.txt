The rain the moon in all my life The wind tonight blows all my dreams I remember the time when we used To be happy together Every moment I spent by your side Was a moment of love Now I wait for your touch in the dark And you're driving me crazy And I have been such a fool thinking you Could forever be mine Tell me now tell me now Tell me now tell me why Tell me baby When I look in your eyes I can't see That you're fooling my pride I remember the taste of your love And the strenght of your feelings And those memories are stronger than ever They hurt me so much Tell me now tell me now Tell me now tell me why Tell me baby Why it's getting so hard to believe You belong to the past The rain in all my life
