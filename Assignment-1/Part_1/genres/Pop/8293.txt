Whenever you want me baby I'll bring you the sun Whenever you need me darling I'll shine in the dark If you only could understand Whatelse do you want me to do If only you could see the reasons why I wanted to come back to you How many times Do I have to cry all along the way How many lies Do I have to bear to be yours again Whenever you want me baby I'll bring you the sun Wheneever you need me darling I'll shine in the dark If only we could turn the pages Forget how we've wasted our time If only we could say the things we've never said There's no higher mountain to climb How many times Do I have to loose all along the way How many thing Do I have to learn then to loose again Whenever you want me baby if only I could find the answer You're always the reasons to be there
