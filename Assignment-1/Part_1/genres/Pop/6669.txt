Wasn't so long ago I needed help Didn't know where to turn thought that I was by myself Then a friend came to me and told me God could set me free Since that day I knew that God love me Everyday I call him Not just Sunday morning' And he is always there And it Feels Good Feels Good to call your name And know that you'll be there Feels good to hear you say You watch me everywhere And when I am down I know that I can always come to you in prayer Just to know I can always count on you Sure Feels Good I remember driving home late one night My head fell I grew tired I just had to close my eyes I didn't know how I stayed on the road but somehow I made it through The only thing that I could do is lift my hands to you Feels Good to call your name And know that you'll be there Feels good to hear you say You watch me everywhere And when I am down I know that I can always come to you in prayer Just to know I can always count on you Sure Feels Good For God loved the world that he gave his only son So that you and I could see how our life was meant to be And it Feels Good
