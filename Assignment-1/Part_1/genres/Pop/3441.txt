Night time We're not alone if we dream together Of the good times We got through coz we won't surrender Head on my shoulder glass of red wine If we left the night behind We have won this already La la la li la la la li I watched you reach for the sky La la la li la la la li Chrysalis to butterfly Sometimes You don't win gold you don't win silver At the right time You'll find bronze makes you the winner Tears running freely and I dry from your cheek If you left the night behind You have won this already La la la li la la la li I watched you reach for the sky La la la li la la la li Chrysalis to butterfly To butterfly Kiss your lips and watch you fly My butterfly Chrysalis to butterfly It's bedtime Emotions chase us our dreams will follow It's a good time mmmmm For me to give you the strength I borrowed Sigh when I hold you Last drop of wine If you left the night behind I have won this already
