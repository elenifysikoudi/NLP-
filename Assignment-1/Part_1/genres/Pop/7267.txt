Feels like I've been here forever Why can't you just intervene Do you see the tears keep falling And I'm falling apart at the seems But you never said the road would be easy But you said that you would never leave And you never promised that this life wasn't hard But you promised you'd take care of me So I'll stop searching for the answers I'll stop praying for an escape And I'll trust you god with where I am And believe that you will have your way Just have your way Just have your way When my friends and my family have left me And I feel so ashamed and so cold Remind me that you take broken things And turn them into gold So I'll stop searching for the answers I'll stop praying for an escape And I'll trust you god with where I am And believe that you'll have your way Just have your way Just have your way Even if my dreams have died And even if I don't survive I'll still worship you with all my life My life Whoa oh And I'll stop searching for the answers I'll stop praying for an escape And I'll trust you god with where I am And believe that you will have your way Just have your way Just have your way I know you will I won't forget Whoa oh You love me Have your way Yeah
