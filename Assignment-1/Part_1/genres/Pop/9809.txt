Never thought it'd be like this It's you an only you I miss An empty bed a bleeding heart Reminds me that you're so far away Chorus I know you hear me when I sing Letting you know the thoughts you bring A lovely smile your face Wherever you are You are so near so far Everyday this aching grows Pierced my heart right through my soul The way we held the words we spoke Gives me strength when I am alone Friends say it's time to let it go They say that it's been way too long But tell me how can I go on alone I thought we'd be together You and I forever chorus If I had wings I would fly in your direction Sail the seven seas To have you near And I would never ever let you part For you would always Be here in my heart chorus
