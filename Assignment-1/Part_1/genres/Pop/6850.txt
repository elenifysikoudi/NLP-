Still waters run deep now I've been watching you so long I know that something's twisted I know that something's wrong How long ago Did you consult your heart You consult your heart Tend it as i Should do too My true and tender comfort That is what I offer you Ooh it's so easy not to say that It's so easy not to do How long ago How long now Will you remain apart Split your head and heart Keep them not apart You must consult your heart Tend it as I should do too Tend it as I wish I could Tend it as I should do too Tend it as I wish I could do too This isn't my fault It is a why mode
