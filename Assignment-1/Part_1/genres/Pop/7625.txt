Holding back what you feel inside It just ain't good no it just ain't right Communication is the key if I tell you will you tell me Tell me how you feel got to know what's on your mind Tell me how you feel cause it's no good to keep Those thoughts locked inside because I want to know I want to know Do you feel how I feel I want to know I want to know I won't pretend that I know what you're all about Why don't you share yourself and you'll leave me in no doubt Reveal your inner self cast aside your mask Show me just who you are Is it really too much to ask Tell me how you feel cause I want to know What's on your mind Tell me how you feel cause it's no good to keep Those thoughts locked inside What are you like I really must know Emotions run deep So let them flow What are you like I really must know Tell me Tell me how you feel 'Cause I want to know What's on your mind Tell me how you feel 'Cause it's no good to keep Those thoughts locked inside
