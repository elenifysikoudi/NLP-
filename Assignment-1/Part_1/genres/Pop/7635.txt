It's been a while But your smile always Brightens up my day I guess you know Because it show You can see it On my face Feels like You've put a spell on me Feels like You've captured me And baby This is how I feel Don't need the sun to shine To make me smile Don't care if it's dark outside Cause I've got you And though the rain may fall No I won't care at all Cause baby I know that I got you Everyday there's a change You bring out the best in me My inner soul is what you know That is how you speak to me You seem to understand You know just who I am And baby this is how I feel Don't need the sun to shine To make me smile Don't care if it's dark outside Cause I've got you And though the rain may fall No I won't care at all Cause baby I know that I got you Don't need a rocket man To help me touch the sky I don't need to fly a plane To get this high Don't need to hitch a ride When I could run a million miles Yes I would just to see you smile Don't need the sun to shine To make me smile Don't care if it's dark outside Cause I've got you And though the rain may fall No I won't care at all Cause baby I know that I got you
