All the pictures on the wall The sand lying on the floor The bed upstairs still unmade The dust float in the light The people just left All laughter and mess Forgetting this and that And rushing back The front door open The music still playing in one room Down the hall And towels on the floor And then it's quiet Just the bees and birds The summer haze Of the trees and the air Feeds it all feeds it all We can all feel it Like a light hand on your back Welcoming you We can all feel it Like a light hand on your back Welcoming you The day before we went to war The day before we went to war We can all feel it All the parasols and kids at play The sea so still and calm Blue as the cloudless sky Just the gentle hum Of the summer's goings on Broken by the sudden rush Of two planes Flying low and fast Into the sun into the sun We can all feel it Like a light hand on your back Welcoming you We can all feel it Like a light hand on your back Welcoming you The day before we went to war The day before we went to war We can all feel it We can all feel it Like a light hand on your back Welcoming you We can all feel it Like a light hand on your back Welcoming you The day before we went to war The day before we went to war The day before we went to war
