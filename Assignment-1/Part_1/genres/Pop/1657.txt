In the town the people stay away From the midnight well For it's dark and evil so they say The midnight well They'll tell you a tale of a lovely young maid The fairest that they'd ever known What a beauty they say But she went her own way On that night she set out on her own For they say she had a rendezvous At the midnight well With a gypsy man she barely knew At the midnight well Nobody knew where he came from But they remember the fire in his eyes His earring of gold And his hair black as coal And a look that could just hypnotize When he said Come away come away with me Come here and lay with me Come away out of the light Come away come away Come and ride with me into the night Never more they never saw her face At the midnight well She was gone and never left a trace At the midnight well They say when the summer nights come to an end The harvest moon glows in the sky A black horse will appear and a sound you will hear As the ghost of a gypsy flies by And he says Come away come away with me Come here and lay with me Come away out of the light Come away come away Come and ride with me into the night Come away come away with me Come here and lay with me Come away out of the light Come away come away Come and ride with me into the night Come away come away with me Come here and lay with me Come away out of the light Come away come away Come and ride with me into the night
