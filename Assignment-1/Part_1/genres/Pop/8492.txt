years ago I knew that I wasnt opened up I heard em all talk about how this world was tough I met a man who told me how he lived it up he had a plan to make the most and do what he loved don't let it pass you by live your life enjoy the ride how long you been taught to take your time but you know things'll always be the same you'll be better off running you'll be better off running you'll be better off running wasn't hard to understand where he was comin from never disregard all the time you have while you're young he spoke about the time he was broke and fallin into love but never doubt that he would still joke and have his fun don't let it pass you by live your life enjoy the ride how long you been taught to take your time but you know things'll always be the same you'll be better off running you'll be better off running you'll be better off running
