You are an obsession I cannot sleep I am a possession unopened at your feet There's no balance No equality Be still I will not accept defeat I will have you Yes I will have you I will find a way and I will have you Like a butterfly A wild butterfly I will collect you and capture you You are an obsession You're my obsession Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me You are an obsession You're my obsession Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me I feed you and drink you by day and by night I need you I need you by sun and candle light You protest You want to leave Stay Oh There's no alternative You see some beauty here I see some beauty there But I see danger Stranger beware A circumstance When you make your dreams Your affection is not what it seems You are an obsession You're my obsession My fantasy has turned to madness And all my goodness has turned to badness My need to possess you has consumed my soul My life is trembling I have no control I will have you Yes I will have you You are an obsession You're my obsession You are an obsession You're my obsession You are an obsession You're my obsession
