Do you wanna know the truth baby Or something beautiful I wanna tell you the truth baby There's something you should know I can tell the stars to grant all of your wishes Tell me is this sin even it's been forgiven And I could paint your sky in the middle of the winter So tell is it still true even if you're bitter Is it clear now my dear What's been happenin here Maybe it's over now it feels so much colder now See it all in my mind are we wastin our lives If this is over now ooh could it be over now Do you wanna know the truth baby Or something beautiful I wanna tell you the truth baby Is something you should know Come on girl yeah you know that you have it When I first saw you it was magic Took a couple left turns now it's tragic Oh no no no oh no no no Every time that you felt the separation You needed love but you lost in translation You wanna have it though my lug from out the basement Oh no no no oh no no no See you all in my mind no more wasting our lives If this is over now ooh baby it's over now Do you wanna know the truth baby Or something beautiful I wanna tell you the truth baby There is something you should know We could write our life story Like blowing trees yeah But I know you and you know me And this our reality yeah Do you wanna know the truth baby Or something beautiful I wanna tell you the truth baby There is something you should know Do you wanna know the truth baby Or something beautiful I wanna tell you the truth baby There is something you should know
