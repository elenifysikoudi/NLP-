Two months have come and gone Since I walked out the door Now I'm left here kicking myself 'Cause you deserve much more Infinite reason Why I shouldn't let you go But I shut you out my life How could I have been so cold Just cause I thought Alone I'd solve my problems Thought I'd move on That I could break the wave I'm gone Am I running away from what we should be And I'm lost My conscience keep telling me constantly That maybe I'm wrong cause we both belong Together as one meets our destiny And I'm lost without your love I will be A rebel without a cause Why'd I leave why'd I leave Why'd I have to be so rebellious Why'd I leave why'd I leave Why'd I have to be so rebellious Why'd I leave why'd I leave Why'd I have to be so rebellious I wish I knew what's going on inside your head So I could hear all of the words you left unsaid I'm just too far away and you're too far moved on oh Hope I haven't lost your love how did I wait too long Just cause I thought Alone I'd solve my problems Thought I'd move on That I could break the wave I'm gone Am I running away from what we should be And I'm lost My conscience keep telling me constantly That maybe I'm wrong cause we both belong Together as one meets our destiny And I'm lost without your love I will be A rebel without a cause Why'd I leave why'd I leave Why'd I have to be so rebellious Why'd I leave why'd I leave Why'd I have to be so rebellious Why'd I leave why'd I leave Why'd I have to be so rebellious A rebel without a cause Rebel without a cause A rebel without a cause
