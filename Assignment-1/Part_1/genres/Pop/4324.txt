Languish won't you leave me 'Cause I'm trying so hard And still I feel the weight of Every pound like an anchor to the ground And sometimes I hear myself sing on before I try and even if I did it all wrong Would that be so wrong It's been so long oh So give me the heat up on the floor I need to feel the blood rush more I want to be CARELESS Why can't I be CARELESS Give it to me I'm down on the floor Make me believe this can't be ignored I want to be CARELESS Why can't I be CARELESS with you CARELESS with you It's not my business but he burn bridges Knowing I'll never see but That don't make no difference Assume the senses I'm not losing sleep And sometimes I hear myself sing on before I try and even if I did it all wrong Would that be so wrong It's been so long oh So give me the heat up on the floor I need to feel the blood rush more I want to be CARELESS Why can't I be CARELESS Give it to me I'm down on the floor Make me believe this can't be ignored I want to be CARELESS Why can't I be CARELESS with you CARELESS with you Why can't I be why can't I be why can't I be CARELESS with you Why can't I be why can't I be why can't I be CARELESS Bury me in anything I know You want to Bury me in anything you know That I want you So give me the heat up on the floor I need to feel the blood rush more I want to be CARELESS Why can't I be CARELESS Give it to me I'm down on the floor Make me believe this can't be ignored I want to be CARELESS Why can't I be CARELESS with you Bury me in anything I know You want to Bury me in anything you know That I want you Cause I'm trying so hard And still I feel the weight of Every pound like an anchor to the ground And sometimes I hear myself sing on before Bury me in anything I know You want to Bury me in anything you know That I want you
