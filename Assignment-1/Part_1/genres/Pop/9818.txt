I don't want to see your face I don't want to hear your name I don't want a thing Just stay away baby Don't wanna know if you're alright Or what you're doin with your life Don't wanna hear you say that you'll stay in touch maybe I'll get by just fine And if you're goin then darlin goodbye goodbye Chorus Don't call me in the middle of the night no more Don't expect me to be there Don't think that it will be the way it was before Don't think that I care I'm not over you yet And I don't want to be your friend I'll forget we ever met I'll forget I ever let Ever let you into this heart of mine baby You just gotta let me be You gotta keep away from me Cause all I want to be is just free from you baby Don't come around Don't say you still care about me Go now go now chorus Baby it's killing me I'll get by just fine So if you're goin then darlin goodbye goodbye chorus
