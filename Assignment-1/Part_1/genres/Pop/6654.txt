Fade in black to white our time is over Still haven't heard from you vanished with out a clue I know you're hurting but at least tell me that you're okay Admit to my mistake and you should know That it's killing me inside and I'm not tryin to hide I wrote this letter but I'd rather say it face to face 'Cause if sorry never comes my heart will not go on Until I make this right so baby please let me apologize 'Cause I'll never love again until I get the chance To right this wrong I've done I can't move on if sorry never comes Winter turns to spring and I am changing Now I'm a different guy hurting you changed my life I wanna tell you but you never answer my phone calls I'm prayin everyday that you'll forgive me I need to hear you say you're heart's not filled with hate I'm writing letter's but I'd rather see you face to face 'Cause if sorry never comes my heart will not go on Until I make this right so baby please let me apologize 'Cause I'll never love again until I get the chance To right this wrong I've done I can't move on if sorry never comes I'm tired of thinkin tired of dreamin I'm losing sleep I need some closure cause this pain is to much for me Just a minute of your time let me say what's on my mind Then you can go on with your life If sorry never comes my heart will not go on Until I make this right so baby please let me apologize 'Cause I'll never love again until I get the chance To right this wrong I've done I can't move on if sorry never comes
