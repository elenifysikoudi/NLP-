You see my anxious heart You see what I am feeling And when I fall apart You are there to hold me How great Your love for me Now I see what You're thinking You say I'm beautiful Your voice is my healing Without You I just can't get by So I'm Hanging on to every word You speak 'Cause it's all that I need Hanging on to every word You say To light up my way Even every little whisper I'm Hanging on as if it were my life I'm hanging on And when the darkness falls I can't see what's before me Your voice is like the dawn Always there to guide me Without You I just can't get by So I'm Hanging on to every word You speak 'Cause it's all that I need Hanging on to every word You say To light up my way Even every little whisper I'm Hanging on as if it were my life I'm hanging on You know me better than I know myself Better than anybody else Your love is sounding like a ringing bell Oh oh I won't let go Hanging on to every word You speak 'Cause it's all that I need Hanging on to every word You say To light up my way Even every little whisper I'm Hanging on as if it were my life I'm hanging on
