Tears roll down my face Smiles can't take their place Living down hanging around try to understand All you gotta do us hold my hand You don't understand Try to see the plan Cause if you start to falling To the things you did before You ain't gonna see me anymore And it's high time You got something going Everything you did till now is wrong Look like my time I'd should be a knowing I should find out before too long SOLO And it's high time You got something going Everything you did till now was wrong Look like my time I'd should be a knowing I should find out before too long
