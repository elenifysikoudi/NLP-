You have come to show me another side of you The part where you are selfish in everything you do Imagine what I'm feeling and what this does to me You have got me feeling that you don't care for me I don't feel that on your mind It's how you make me feel It's give and take when you try to get it right I don't think you understand You haven't taken time You and I we cannot survive When one of us is trying and one is in denial If you stop believing then baby let me know And I won't try to stop you I will let you go I wish that you would listen to what I have to say I am trying to save us so don't you walk away I don't feel that on your mind It's how you make me feel Um oh oh oh It's give and take when you try to get it right I don't think you understand You haven't taken time You and I we cannot survive When one of us is trying and one is in denial I don't think you know me Give a little away too late I don't think I ask too much but still you hesitate I want back the old days times we didn't fight Right now things ain't working out I want to get it right But it's It's give and take when you try to get it right I don't think you understand You haven't taken time You and I we cannot survive When one of us is trying and one is in denial
