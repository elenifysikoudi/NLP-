This adrenaline rush is keeping me high Keep it coming around It keeps the days alive it makes the hours fly Keep it coming around When the holdups start holding you down Keep your eyes to the ground And when the holdups start holding us down Just keep your eyes to the ground For I cannot disgrace myself When the motion steers for the very first time Don't give the game away When it raises its head and it threatens to stay Don't give the game away And my time is tabled and my clock is on time I can keep it alive And my day is set and I haven't stopped yet I can carry on fine For I will have to do it myself Set up the day Give it away And everything I've been thinking of With no time to think There's no time to sink I'm looking out for an ambush From beginning to end Attention to bend There can be no interruption Set up the day Give it away And stop this motion from slowing This adrenaline rush is keeping me high Keep it coming around It keeps the days alive it makes the hours fly Keep it coming around And my time is tabled and my clock is on time I can keep it alive And my day is set and I haven't stopped yet I can carry on fine For I will have to do it myself Set up the day Give it away And everything I've been thinking of With no time to think There's no time to sink I'm looking out for an ambush From beginning to end Attention to bend There can be no interruption Set up the day Give it away Don't stop this motion from slowing Set up the day Give it away And everything I've been thinking of With no time to think There's no time to sink I'm looking out for an ambush From beginning to end Attention to bend There can be no interruption Set up the day Give it away Don't stop this motion from slowing
