Spoken Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful And suddenly i saw debris Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes words can't bring me down So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The piece is gone left the puzzle undone That's the way it is You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down You are beautiful in every single way Yes words can't bring you down Don't you bring me down today No matter what we do no matter what we do No matter what they say no matter what they say When the sun is shining through Then the clouds won't stay And everywhere we go everywhere we go The sun won't always shine sun won't always shine But tomorrow will find a way All the other times 'cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes words won't bring us down oh no We are beautiful in every single way Yes words can't bring us down Don't you bring me down today Don't you bring me down today Don't you bring me down today
