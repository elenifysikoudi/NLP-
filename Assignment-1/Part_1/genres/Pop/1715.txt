Girls girls girls Girls girls girls Girls girls girls Girls girls girls Well yellow red black or white Add a little bit of moonlight For this intercontinental romance Shy girls sexy girls they all like that fancy world Champagne a gentle song a slow dance Who makes it fun to spend your money Who calls you honey most every day Girls girls girls Girls girls girls Well they made em up in Hollywood And put em into the movies Those lovely photographic splendors In and out of magazines Miss World and beauty queens Falling in love with the real big spenders But although their world may be frantic Theyre still romantic in their own way So hop on the world is swinging Dont sit and twiddle your thumbs Get up and meet those pretty girls girls girls Step on the world keeps swinging Put on the dazzling charm Get up and find those pretty girls Dont rush keep it nice and gentle And sentimental for that certain moment Moonlit oceans girls full of emotions Stepping on that slow boat to China And next door in Japan they know how to please a man Calling in for tea with my geisha Theyve got that old fashioned feeling When it comes to pleasing they know their way So hop on the world is swinging Dont sit and twiddle your thumbs Get up and meet those pretty girls girls girls Step on the world keeps swinging Put on the dazzling charm Get up and find those pretty girls Dont rush keep it nice and gentle And sentimental for that certain moment when you draw back the curtain So hop on the world is swinging Dont sit and twiddle your thumbs Get up and meet those pretty girls Ooh forever Girls girls girls Girls girls girls Girls girls girls girls girls
