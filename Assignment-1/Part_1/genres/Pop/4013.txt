In your life your mad In your car your sad O your taller now I've found Hold your fire course O your fallen out Go and sow your courses If I rise they are on my drive If I believe it's more than it is More than it is If I rise one more chance All our dreams more than this O your taller now I've found Hold your fire course O your fallen out Go and sow your courses If I rise they are on my drive If I believe it's more than it is It's more than it is If I thought I wanted more Get the life more Just one more call Though I've never lost Believe I don't care Never again If I rise they are on my drive If I believe it's more than it is It's more than it is If I thought I wanted more Get the life more Just one more call If I believe there's more than this Anymore than this
