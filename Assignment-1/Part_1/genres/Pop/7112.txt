All the things I want to say but I can't All the things I want to do but I won't Hold me tight Not too tight I'm in knots but you tie me in bows I feel pretty I know that you care You're so sweet You're so so sweet It's not a hurry that we're in It's the pollen It's the spring But I can't make me love you And you can't make me either Patience Boy I need it I can't make me love you Oh oh oh Paper pen and a piece of your heart I can read it but where do I start What to do What do I do An I am going but I'm gonna come back And maybe then Maybe this maybe that Hold me tight Not too tight It's not a hurry that were in There's no problem That's the thing But I can't make me love you And you can't make me either Patience Boy I need it I can't make me love you Oh Everyday there's something new to hold onto A little more of you But I Can't make me love you And you can't make me either Patience Boy I need it I can't make me love you Patience Boy on strange days I can't make me love you Oh oh oh
