When the world is seeing yellow I only see grey When everybody sees the rainbow I'm stuck in the rain You take a little piece of me Every time you leave I don't think that I'll ever find that silver lining Or a reason to smile You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams Now I'm colorblind colorblind When did my heart Get so full of the never mind never mind Did you know That you stole the only thing I needed Always black and white in my eyes I'm colorblind Ain't it funny that you managed To just wash away Even pictures that you're not in Have started to fade I tried to play my favorite songs But I can't sing along The words don't feel the same You've taken all the best things from me And thrown them away You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams Now I'm colorblind colorblind When did my heart get so full of the never mind never mind Did you know That you stole the only thing I needed Always black and white in my eyes I'm colorblind I'll wait For roses to be red again And I hate That you took my blue from the ocean Give me back green greens and golden's My purples my blues you stole them How long will I be broken You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams Now I'm colorblind colorblind When did my heart get so full of the never mind never mind Did you know That you stole the only thing I needed Only black and white in my eyes I'm colorblind It's only black and white in my eyes I'm colorblind
