When did chivalry become such a crime When you take her out try showing up on time When you pick her up don't just wait outside like some taxi ride So if you want her to want you Here's exactly what you gonna need to do Show her some ol fashion lovin' Like when a kiss meant somethin' When a man opened doors And would give up his coat when she's cold Bring back that ol fashion lovin' When those three words meant somethin' When a man knew how to romance Oh let's make it that way just like back in the day oh Just remember what Aretha said you got to show her Oh show that woman some respect Five minute love just don't mean a thing So if you want her to want you Here's exactly what she's gonna need from you Show her some ol fashion lovin' Like when a kiss meant somethin' When a man opened doors And would give up his coat when she's cold Bring back that ol fashion lovin' When those three words meant somethin' When a man knew how to romance Oh let's make it that way just like back in the day Flowers and candies and diamonds are nice But give her the things that money can't buy Like quality time treating her right and knowin what's on her mind Show her some ol fashion lovin' Like when a kiss meant somethin' When a man opened doors And would give up his coat when she's cold Bring back that ol fashion lovin' When those three words meant somethan' When a man knew how to romance Oh let's make it that way just like back in the day Ol fashion lovin' Like when a kiss meant somethin' When a man opened doors And would give up his coat when she's cold
