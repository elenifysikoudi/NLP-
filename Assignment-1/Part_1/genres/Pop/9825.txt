Lick my wounds Suck the venom There's our shelter There's our shed Broke a tooth and made a move Before the storm Caught a bird into my hands To make a bond Loving is a poison is a hologram Bleeding feet and desert beach in ochre sand Does it make a difference if the pirates land If we put aside our golden privacy No one will be left behind I guarantee I guarantee Lick my wounds Suck the venom There's our shelter There's our shed Trustfully and gracefully I'm lost at sea Shallow waters don't appear a threat to me We should row together to an island I know Rearrange the riddle and reset the core Reset the core Lick my wounds Suck the venom There's our shelter There's our shed Lick my wounds Suck the venom There's our shelter There's our shed
