You've got me You've got me You've got me You've got me speechless Where you been baby Waited for you all day Waited for you to use the key That opens my place My heart starts trembling As I hear your footsteps pace Lock opens doorknob turns There appears your face Going out my head I think I'm loosing all my mind Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world In your arms lost for words you've got me Laying so closely I feel your skin rubbing and touching me Only sweat between us feeling you kissing and pleasing me I rub your back I kiss your neck I know that you love when we touch like that I can feel you need me feels so good to me feels so good to me Going out my head I think I'm loosing all my mind Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world In your arms lost for words you've got me Yes yes yes Yes yes yes Speechless All I can say is Yes yes yes All I can say is Yes yes yes Kiss me Hold me You've got me Speechless
