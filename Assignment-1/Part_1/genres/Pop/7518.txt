Maybe I'm a fool One day we'll know Maybe I'm a fool Only time can show But now these lonely nights are killing me I'm so far away from reality The pain grows stronger I can't hold on much longer I can still remember That day in September The words that set you free Lucky Be a man and try and understand Lucky Be a man if you can Lucky You know I really Really love you so But Lucky I still have to go Baby can't you see That tears on my face Painful memories of a love I can't replace I'm sailing in the past and I'm sinking fast You can hear my S O S crying out for tenderness Though yesterday's dead and gone Your magic still lingers on I can still remember that day in September The words that set you free Lucky Be a man and try and understand
