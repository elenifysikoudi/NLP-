Reflections bitter sweet Thoughts of tomorrow we may never keep Beauty of life in joy and pain Make me a dove lord Free to fly away When the wind blows And the sun shines And the trees rock side to side And the rain begins to fall It's cause you're not here When the night falls And there's darkness And the stars light up the sky 'Cause the moor refuses to shine It's cause you're not here If I could touch the sky There'll be no reason for you and I How I wish that I could fly And be free as a butterfly Here's tomorrow without promise Just another day gone by There's no hope for you and I It's cause you're not here When I'm lonely and I'm crying Feelin sorry for myself I don't want nobody else It's cause you're not here If I could touch the sky There'll be no reason for you and I How I wish that I could fly And be free as a butterfly When you're not here If I could fly I'd fly away Away from here I don't want nobody else If it's not you And you're not here
