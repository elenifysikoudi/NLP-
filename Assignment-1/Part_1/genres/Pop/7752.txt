VERSE 1 Visions explode hearts that won't sleep And dreams that seem untold The future it brings If God made us lights Then we must shine bright Everyone standing tall Hand in hand sowing seeds of Love of faith and hope And we know that love will conquer all so Let's spread love In the air Everywhere we go 2x VERSE 2 If you think about the things that make everyone cry You'll see that its lack of love And think about the people that cause pain everyday I wish they knew this love Because this love will make us stand so strong Because this love will never make us fall VERSE 3 Now think about the mass destruction everywhere The killings and earthquake All over the streets there is chaos everyday The scream of wickedness But with love our soul would rise above darkness With true love no wrong will make us cry CHORUS Let's spread love In the air Everywhere we go 2x VERSE 4 The pains feel so much to bear And even though we fight we cannot make it right All I'm saying is if we truly want to love There is just one source and that is Jesus Just think about it breathing love Teaching love Living love L ove of faith and hope When we all can pray to the almighty That all we need is the prince of peace L ove of faith and hope And he has got the whole world Whole wide world in his hands And he has got the whole world Whole wide world VERSE 5 REGGAE Spread love in the air Everywhere we go Me a light it up up up in the air Everywhere me a go And I can see another day Coming to my way Where evil and darkness will exist no more For we could make now the time To leave behind the past So that the future love brings Will make us to smile Hit me one time Or make it two times If me a sleeping make I wake up to the situation rising Me father is the creator And I am a victor Born transformed to dominate the land So tell me what a man can't do If the king of all kings inna behind your dreams beloved Our nation is love come true So get up on your feet and walk in the light beloved RAP 1 I went undercover and I discover That without love no one is better No one is stronger or can cast asunder No dream is clearer and no truth is greater And these lives we live we all need the father Because with love there is light and it shines brighter So when we stand tall we will never fall One with God lives lives forever more RAP 2 I just can't sit there and watch people say what they want to say do what they want to do and hurt people anyway Because the basis of the reason we're created is to be love's family and I don't see it happening What's the difference you're black or white or colored but whatever our difference shouldn't make us kill our honor We need no war but spread God's word it's the only way we heal our world CHORUS Let's spread love In the air Everywhere we go
