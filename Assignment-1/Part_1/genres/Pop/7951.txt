If you should hear that someone new Has eased the pain of losing you Don't you believe it not for a moment Don't you believe it because it isn't true Those angry words that made us part Put out the flame that's in my heart Don't you believe it not for a moment Don't you believe it because it isn't true I haven't changed I still love you And it will always be I only hope and I pray each night You'll feel the same about me So if you hear some false alarms Like you're not welcome in my arms Don't you believe it not for a moment Don't you believe it because it isn't true Oh how I still love you
