Just got done workin' On my way home and sittin on the 405 Friday night it's the weekend all day thinkin' What I'm gonna do tonight I called my boys to see if they Wanna a go and chill tonight Now it's on so we're to the spot Where the music's cool and the girls are hot It's Friday night I'm feeling good I cashed my paycheck and I should Go and spread myself around Find a girl and get on down Everybody's dancin on the floor Either by themselves or with someone I know you didn't come to stand around So if you want to groove then let's get down Everybody's feelin good tonight The girls in the place are just so fine I know you didn't come to stand around So if you want to groove then let's get Down down down down X2 Chillin on the dance floor getting my groove on Floatin on a natural high White Black Puerto Rican Everybody's feelin Just so good tonight My girl is fly she knows I like That way she's dancin with me tonight I'm feelin like the man now I don't really care if we dance all night So don't be shy nobody cares Throw your hands up in the air Fella's don't just stand around Find a girl and get on down Chorus If it's been awhile since you had a real good time The feelin's good and everything's alright So if you want to groove Then let your body move Cause this party's goin till the break of dawn Get into the groove and let's get down Breakdown Chorus out Written by Jamie Jones Geoff Gill Martin Kember
