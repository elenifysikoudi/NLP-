I guess I thought you'll be here forever Another illusion I chose to create You don't know what you got until it's gone And found out a little too late I was acting as if you were lucky to have me Doin you a favor I hardly knew you were there But then you were gone and it was all wrong I didn't know how much I cared Now being without you Takes a lot of getting used to Should learn to live with it But I don't want to Living without you Is all a big mistake Instead of getting easier It's the hardest thing to take I'm addicted to ya baby You're a hard habit to break You found someone else you had every reason You know I can't blame you for runnin to him Two people together but living alone I was spreading my love too thin After all these years I'm still tryin to shake it Doin much better they say that it Just takes time But deep in the night it's an endless flight I can't get ya out of my mind Now being without you Takes a lot of getting used to Should learn to live with it But I don't want to Living without you Is all a big mistake Instead of getting easier It's the hardest thing to take I'm addicted to ya baby You're a hard habit to break I can't just get it off off I can't just get it off off Being without you Takes a lot of getting used to Should learn to live with it I don't want to Being without you Is all a big mistake Instead of getting easier It's the hardest thing to take I'm addicted to ya baby You're a hard habit to break I can't just get it off off I can't just get it off off I can't just get it off off I can't just get it off off I can't just get it off off I can't just get it off off I can't just get it off off I can't just get it off off
