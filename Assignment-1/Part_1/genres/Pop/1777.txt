They say the skies of Lebanon are burning Those mighty cedars bleeding in the heat They're showing pictures on the television Women and children dying in the street And we're still at it in our own place Still trying to reach the future through the past Still trying to carve tomorrow from a tombstone But hey don't listen to me This wasn't meant to be no sad song We've heard too much of that before Right now I only want to be with you Till the mornin dew comes fallin' And I want to take you to the island Trace your footprints in the sand And in the evening when the sun goes down We'll make love to the sound of the ocean They're raisin banners over by the markets White washing slogans on our ship yard walls Witch doctors praying for a mighty showdown No way our holy flag is gonna fall Up here we sacrifice our children To feed the worn out dreams of yesterday And teach them dying will lead us into glory But hey don't listen to me 'Cause this wasn't meant to be no sad song I've sung too much of that before Right now I only want to be with you Till the mornin dew comes fallin' I want to take you to the island Trace your footprints in the sand And in the evening when there's no one around We'll make love to the sound of the ocean Now I know us plain folks don't see all the story And I know this peace and love's just copping out And I guess these young boys dyin in the ditches Is just what being free is all about And how this twisted wreckage down main street Will bring us all together in the end And we'll go marching down the road to freedom Freedom Freedom
