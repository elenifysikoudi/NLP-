Go to the Empire State and watch the city lights Hear the noise of millions struggle in the sprawl Stare into the sky we're few and far between Black eyes full of stars wide with memories Every street I ever walked Every home I ever had Is lost Every flower I ever held Every spring I ever had Has died Every man I ever knew Every woman I ever had Is gone Everything I ever touched Everything I ever had Has died Lie down in the park and watch the satellites Hear the children sing just a breath away Dance in the heavy air along the interstate Black lung full of fumes choke on memories Every street I ever walked Every home I ever had Is lost Every flower I ever held Every spring I ever had Has died Every man I ever knew Every woman I ever had Is gone Everything I ever touched Everything I ever had Has died
