Higher than the highest mountain deeper than the eye can see words are falling out like prayers none nearer to my heart than thee lines I walk are not the straightest clouds fill up my head again plagued with merely indecision I reach out in search of life I see the oasis but the water it's too deep I dont want to get lost in the water it's too deep night comes I will build my refuge and hope its not destroyed in light bring to my life truth and worse I reach out in spite of life I see the oasis but the water it's too deep I dont want to get lost in the water it's too deep heart and head work as one let me drink and move on still my faith in rising suns always leads me here I see the oasis but the water it's too deep I dont want to get lost in the water it's too deep
