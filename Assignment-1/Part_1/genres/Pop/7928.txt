We have a date to meet again remember It's been so wonderful to be with you 'Til we meet again please think of me 'Cause I will be thinking of you We have a date to dream again remember We have a date to dream all through the night There's so much more that I have to tell you Next time I hold you tight I'll call you every day my darling And I'll get through the week somehow Hate to break away my darling So long for now so long for now We have a date to love again remember It's been so wonderful to be with you Counting the moments until I see you That's what my heart and I will do
