When the snowman brings the snow Well he just might like to know He's put a great big smile on somebody's face And if you jump into your bed Quickly cover up your head Don't you lock the doors You know that sweet Santa Claus in on the way Well I wish it could be Christmas every day When the kids start singing and the band begins to play Oh I wish it could be Christmas every day So let the bells ring out for Christmas When we're skating in the park If the snow cloud makes it dark Then your rosy cheek's gonna light my merry way Now the frosty paws appear And they've frozen up my ears So we'll lie by the fire 'Til the sleep simply knocks em all away Well I wish it could be Christmas every day When the kids start singing and the band begins to play Oh I wish it could be Christmas every day So let the bells ring out for Christmas Well I wish it could be Christmas every day When the kids start singing and the band begins to play Oh I wish it could be Christmas every day So let the bells ring out for Christmas Well I wish it could be Christmas every day When the kids start singing and the band begins to play Oh oh I wish it could be Christmas every day Let the bells ring out for Christmas Let the bells ring out for Christmas
