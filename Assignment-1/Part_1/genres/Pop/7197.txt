In all day out all night You and I see the sights in paradise Very nice Take me home do it til your hear aches And then you'll know my mind And if I stay I'd only drive you mad I'm not that stable I'm not so right in a way I find myself at odds wanting to be here Never arrive Love and peace Ill at ease with naked greed Hunger feeding aim to please what a teaser Maybe I owe it to my own ways But then I know my mind You see I know I've been there before And if I stay I'd only drive you mad I'm not that stable I'm not so right in a way I find myself at odds wanting to be here Never arrive
