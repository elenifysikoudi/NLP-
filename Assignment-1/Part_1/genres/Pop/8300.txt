Everyday I live I try to hide My fears to be alone Everyday I live you know I try To face my broken life with force I've learned by now to love I've found your shining light above I hold on to your light to be together Recall the time we were so close I hold on to your light to be together With you once again Since the day I was born you took my hands And helped me to survive Everyday we've lived you gave me your love And taught me to be sweet and strong I've learned by now to cry Inside of me you'll never die I hold on to your light to be together I recall the time we were so close I hold on to your light to be together With you once again You'll always lead my way And memories will fill your days I hold on to your light to be together I recall the time we were so close I hold on to your light to be Together now once again Together again again Again
