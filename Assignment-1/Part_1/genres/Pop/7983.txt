Sweet little Jesus boy They made you be born in a manger Sweet little holy child We didn't know who you were Didn't know you'd come to save us Lord To take our sins away Our eyes were blind we could not see We didn't know who you were You have shown us how We are trying Master you have shown us how Even when you were dying Just seems like we can't do right Look how we treated you But please Sir forgive us Lord We didn't know it was you Sweet little Jesus boy Born a long ago Sweet little holy child And we didn't know who you were
