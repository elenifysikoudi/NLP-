Time stands still When you fear your hope is gonna fade Hope doesn't come 'Til you catch your fear and give it away I'm waiting for the tide The darkness of this night to fade into the night And it won't be long I hope it won't be long Oh no Told me they would come Told me they were gonna take him away He's the only one He's the one that makes me feel this way And don't you criticize What you can't understand He's the pulse inside my hand He's the only one he is the only one I see hear taste I breathe him Seven years and thirteen days Oh I wouldn't forsake him My own disturbed angel boy I would wait a thousand years for you Breathe into your heart Let me taste the color of your core Memory rewind To the heady time we had before Coming up I'm coming down Reaching up and falling down The time is coming round And it won't be long I hope it won't be long I see hear taste I breathe him Seven years and thirteen days Oh I wouldn't forsake him My own disturbed angel boy I would wait a thousand years for you Coming up I'm coming down Reaching up and falling down The time is coming round And it won't be long I know it won't be long I see hear taste I breathe him Seven years and thirteen days Oh I wouldn't forsake him My own disturbed angel boy I see hear taste I breathe him Seven years and thirteen days Oh I wouldn't forsake him My own disturbed angel boy I would wait a thousand years for you I would wait a thousand years for you I would wait a thousand years for you
