I think you are not my friend I think you're not on my side I think I made a mistake You try to sneak behind my back But trust can not be stolen Friendship must be earned and affection's not for sale I know you want respect But contempt is all you get from me We are forever unforgiven You call me a traitor But you are a snake An eye for an eye And a tooth for a tooth I think you are in too deep I think you're not what you seem I think I have been a fool I think I should take more care
