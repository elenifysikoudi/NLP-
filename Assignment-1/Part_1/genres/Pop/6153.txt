Ya got something to give Is it something I see in the life that you live Ya got something I need If its something to keep me from falling again We got something to show Got a reason to hold on a little bit more It's not something I know It's a feeling that comes from the base of my soul Don't stop Baby don't stop Love is all we are oh oh It starts raining inside I can see where to go in the back of my mind It's not important to hide As long as we keep one another in sight We got lightning and gold In the palm of our hands but it's out of control We got something to show With the touch of the love we all wanna know Don't stop baby don't stop Don't stop baby don't stop Don't stop baby don't stop Don't stop baby don't stop Don't stop baby don't stop Don't stop baby don't stop Don't stop baby don't stop Don't stop baby don't stop Love is all we are oh oh Gimme a moment A moment of silence
