Twenty years ago I rode By helicopter to the sky I laughed at gravitation For a moment I was free They say I never landed You know they may be right It looks better from above With some distance in between To leave is never easy Perhaps it shouldn't be But return is even harder Yes return is harder still I often dream of flying Far above the city streets I beat my wings and leave For Cairo or New York To leave is never easy Perhaps it shouldn't be But return is even harder Yes return is harder still I can go to many places But there's no one there to meet And the sky is a lonely place Just me and the silent clouds To leave is never easy Perhaps it shouldn't be But return is even harder Yes return is harder still
