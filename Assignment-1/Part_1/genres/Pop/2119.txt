If I were to fall Know I love you If I weren't holding your hand so tight If I were to fall through a crack in time Would I rise or fall Hounded and all aglow If I weren't holding your hand so tight If I weren't caught in the last mistake If I weren't holding the blind remains Would I remember this or end all there is If I weren't holding your hand so tight Then I see you as the mad hero all alone If I were to fall through a crack in time If I were to fall If I were to fall Know I love you
