my wings are like this all my words on his lips and my brain is on edge i'm next to the bed where i saw you my weight is like his we both lost what we kissed and my hate burns like this in my hands in his fist and my love is so quick like the legs of my kids all the worlds i could lift only fit where i saw you pile lover upon lover 'til we're covered with skin there's nothing to discover from the thunder and lightning there's no way to recover this is love not loving but now we are all eachother i was a brother when i saw you
