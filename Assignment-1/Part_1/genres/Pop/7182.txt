I deny feeling inside for a long time and now I realize there are part of everyone like a sleeping hitler There's strength of destruction I thought part of me when pain is the opium But it's much too late to be judged How I wish I was blindly I wish I was blindly I wish I was blindly blindly loved For desire carry the cross of obsession a tumbling of launch I naturally poisoned I'm a sleepig hitler No better than anyone I've learned to be civilized and that is the difference But it's much too late to be judged how I wish I was blindly I wish I was blindly I wish I was blindly I wish I was blindly Wish I was blindly I wish I was I know who you are I'll tell you something I know what you are I know because you showed me I was really out there Oh yes you showed me I was really out there But it's much too late to be judged anymore I wish I was blindly I wish I was blindly I wish I was blindly Wish I was blindly I wish I was Wish I was blindly Wish I was blindly blindly loved blindly loved blindly loved I wish I was blindly loved
