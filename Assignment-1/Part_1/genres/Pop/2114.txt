Sunlight moves through darkened halls the same voice is calling me home time goes back and round again only your name in my head thoughts will pass sleep well tonight I know your demons and delight some time goes back and round again holding the rain in my hand lose your worth and then your heart I know there is no way I will stop I know nothing that I write but i can see your world cant you see mine can you see through my eyes can you see through mine
