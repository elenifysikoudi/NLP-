no heaven will embrace you no harbour keeps you safe your comrades will desert you no tower reaches heaven no fortress stands to last your desires makes you weak no science will be mastered no truth is absolute your children won't lament you no wisdom can be trusted no glory lasts forever our wishes won't be granted like torches in the aeon flow even suns flicker and die forgotten as the ages grow eternity is not for you
