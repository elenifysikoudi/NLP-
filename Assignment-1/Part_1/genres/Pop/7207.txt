I know there's a certain amount To what you're thinking My hopes never seem to amount To more than stopping smoking Everyone knows better I'll do it anyway Everyone knows better oh yeah Heroes never seem To allow for self expression Lovers stick around To allow what they think you're missing Everyone knows better I'll do it anyway Everyone knows better I'll do it anyway Looking around To avoid what's in front of you Good intentions Wrapped round like some old sweater A vain hope That it might be good for you You mind is made Make your mind up Make your mind up Make your mind up We like to make the same mistakes Sunshine A ray of hope in a hopeless situation Suntanned Your reward for the hopeful hours that you spend Burning Everyone knows better I'll do it anyway Everyone knows better I'll do it anyway Everyone knows better I'll do it anyway Everyone thinks they know better I'll do it anyway Looking around To avoid what's in front of you Good intentions Wrapped round like some old sweater A vain hope That it might be good for you Your mind is made
