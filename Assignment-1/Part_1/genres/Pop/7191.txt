Lost my ticket at the gate And now I'm cross and now I'm late The station has a lengthy cue And you said I could be with you But will you still be waiting When I finally get to Where you're waiting to Met you at the old school gate Where you were hanging with your mates You flicked your fingers through your hair It was chilly for that time of year My head went spinning into space Just like you'd smacked me in the face When I got there in the end I caught you snogging with my friend What if she's pretty if she is smart I saw you first you broke my heart And life's not fair and it's so cruel 'Cause you said I could be with you Now I don't think you're good enough And after school I'll beat you up
