I can't believe I could not see Through the mirror of your smile My first mistake was to give in So blinded for a while I thought there was truth I feel so out of touch Feel so out of touch I can't believe it's so hard to go One night affair Can't go spend the night One night affair oh One night affair Feelings in my heart One night affair oh oh I won tonight Should've had doubts So now I feel just like a child It's understood I can play too That's why I'll never lose my smile And now it's the time we have to say goodbye Time to say goodbye I should've known right from the start One night affair Can't go spend the night One night affair oh One night affair Feelings in my heart One night affair oh oh One And now it's the time we have to say goodbye Time to say goodbye I should've known right from the start One night affair Can't go spend the night One night affair oh One night affair Feelings in my heart One night affair oh oh One night affair Can't go spend the night One night affair oh One night affair Feelings in my heart One night affair oh oh One night affair Can't go spend the night One night affair oh oh One night affair Feelings in my heart One night affair
