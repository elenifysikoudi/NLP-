All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out I can't believe I believed Everything we had would last So young and naive for me to think She was from your past Silly of me to dream of One day having your kids Love is so blind It feels right when its wrong I can't believe I fell for four years I'm smarter than that So dumb and naive to believe that with me You're a changed man Foolish of me to compete When you cheat with loose women It took me some time but now I've moved on 'Cause I realized I got Me myself and I That's all I got in the end That's what I found out And it ain't no need to cry I took a vow that from now on I'm a be my own best friend Me myself and I That's all I got in the end That's what I found out And it ain't no need to cry I took a vow that from now I'm a be my own best friend Your so controlling you say that you love me But you don't Your family told me one day I would see it on my own Next thing I know I'm dealing With your three kids in my home Love is so blind it feels right when its wrong Now that its over Stop calling me Come pick up yo clothes No need to front like ya still wit me All your homies know Even your very best friend Tried to warn me on the low It took me some time But now I am strong 'Cause I realized I got Me myself and I That's all I got in the end That's what I found out And it ain't no need to cry I took a vow that from now on I'm a be my own best friend I got me myself and I Must have cried a thousand times I can't regret time spent with you But I lucked out to make it through
