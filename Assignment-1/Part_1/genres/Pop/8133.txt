"Verse 1 I remember the night i was saved And how my whole life was changed The preacher spoke of the cross Forgiveness and grace The choir sang ""Power In The Blood"" As i walked down to the altar to pray After all of these years and so many miles i can say Chorus There's still power in the blood And satan still has to flee There's still hope in the cross And that's what i still believe Verse 2 I knew i needed God's grace I felt so lost and ashamed My misery was so plain to see by the tears on my face But then God reached down His hand He forgave me and broke every chain Now i've been set free so i'll lift my voice and proclaim Sing Chorus Bridge Power Power wonder working power In the blood of the lamb Sing chours Ending That's what I Still believe"
