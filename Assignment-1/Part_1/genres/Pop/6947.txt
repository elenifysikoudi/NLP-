Lonely table just for one in a bright and crowded room While the music has begun i drink to memories in the gloom Though the music's still the same it has a bittersweet refrain So play the song the way it used to be Before she left and changed it all to sadness And maybe if she's passing by the window She will hear a love song and a melody And even if the words are not so tender she will always remember The way it used to be Friends stop by and say hello and i laugh and hide the pain It's quite easy til they go then the song begins again So play the song the way it used to be Before she left and changed it all to sadness And maybe if she's passing by the window she would hear our love song and our melody And even if the words are not so tender She will always remember the way it used to be
