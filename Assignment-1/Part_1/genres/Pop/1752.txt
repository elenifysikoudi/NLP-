So it goes history shows deserts must expand Camels sail like wooden ships like women down The Strand There's sand on Second Avenue and the wind blows like a train Taxi's line up like a strand of pearls around the block again I remembered everything every windowpane Every word came back to me the way it used to be Then I saw your face across the street Through the tears of Hercules There's a bus that leaves at 8 15 and another one at 10 00 Should I climb aboardrisk everything and ride it to the end Watch the hill like roller coasters up into the sky And wish that you were here by me so close that I could die You say love wrecks everything and none of us survive But I got over you last night and I am still alive 'Til I saw your face across the street Through the tears of Hercules
