Give a bit of mmh to me and I'll give a bit of mmh to you Give a bit of mmh to me and I'll give a bit of mmh to you And your eyes like a laser every time cut me deeper Give a bit of mmh to me you're a mystery and I'll give a bit of mmh to you it's so confusing Give a bit of mmh to me you're a mystery and I'll give a bit of mmh to you it's so confusing For me you are an enigma For me you really are a mystery A mystery a mystery For you I break all the rules And for you I'll go to the moon 'Cos you're the one There's no one else There's no one else Chorus Are you devil or angel Are you question or answer Are you real or am I dreaming Chorus
