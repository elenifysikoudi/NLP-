Sometimes I thought I gave you more than my life I just wanna tell you sometimes I thought I gave you more than my life Sometimes sometimes What's going on with me I don't wanna feel this way Without a smile upon my face And if you're leaving now I wanna let you know That I'll be fine and let you go Whatever you wonder baby Whatever you do Sometimes I thought I gave you more than my life I just wanna tell you sometimes I thought I gave you more than my life Sometimes sometimes Don't wanna see me cry You got walk away Get up and leave me all my space I live my night and day Thinking about the way That I believe in God and faith Whatever you wonder baby Whatever you do Sometimes Sometimes I thought I gave you more than my life I just wanna tell you Stop
