Which came first The love or the love song Which is more important In the long run Do you really want to talk about it Take if to the back verada Have a drink and talk around it In the end it doesn't matter In the end we all go home I thought about it for a minute Music's in the kiss we hold Which came first The love or the love song I'm sorry I guess I was wrong Let us find the tune without a sound Find a place no one's found Pick it up and put it down In the end it doesn't matter In the end they all go home I thought about it for a minute Music's in the kiss we hold Music is a walk outside Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh Clever lines and clever lyrics All boil down to what goes in them If they find life then so do we aahhh yeah ah ha I think we're alive Music's in the things that matter Hear it in the kiss we hold Music is a walk outside Which came first The love or the love song
