Backup intro And that was the biggest sin of all Connie It was a sin the way you lied to me The way you broke my heart But that was not the biggest sin of all It was a sin the way you made me cry And vowed we'd never part But that was not the biggest sin of all You promised to be faithful And I trusted in you Oh what a sin You just couldn't be true But the biggest sin of all Was when you made believe you were mine When there was somebody else All the time spoken I should have known you didn't love me With all those lied that you told And I should've known That there was another When your kisses were so cold Yes I closed my eyes Too much in love to see Oh why did this ever have to happen to me reprise Yes the biggest sin of all Was when you made believe you were mine When there was somebody else All the time Backup All the time
