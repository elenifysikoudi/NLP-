Vs 1 If you've started a journey Down a long dusty road If your heart's been searchin' For a place to call home If sin and affliction ooooh Has lead you to grieve My friend be encouraged By these words that I speak Chorus Be not you weary While on this journey For you will reap If you faint not If dark clouds should rise And thunder roll Look to the Master For He's in control Vs 2 If heartache and trouble Is all you've known Peace and contentment Has left you alone But there's One who's waiting waiting With His arms open wide And He gently whispers Heed these words of mine Chorus Instrumental Repeat Chorus Look to the Master for He's in control
