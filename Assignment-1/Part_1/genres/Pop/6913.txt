If you promised that you'd call me And I spent a thousand nights just waiting It would still still still be worth it Just to hear your voice when you call If I ruled the world completely But I had to be slave to love you It would still still still be worth it It would still be worth it my love Unless unless I am holding you What good can these arms be What use what use are these lips of mine If you're not committed to me If I had to die tomorrow Just to share tonight with you It would still still still be worth it It would still be worth it my love
