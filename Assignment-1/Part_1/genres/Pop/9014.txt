Free the dream within The stars are crying a tear A sigh escapes from heaven and worlds end Breathe the dream within the mystifying Chorus We tremble and spin Suspended within Look beyond where hearts can see Dream in peace Trust love believe Chorus Free the dream within A voice is calling a song A prayer from deep inside you To guide you Be the dream within The light is shining I fly on the wind Salvation begins Look beyond where hearts can see Dream in peace Trust love believe Chorus Vocalizing Free the dream within The stars are crying a tear A sigh escapes from heaven And worlds end
