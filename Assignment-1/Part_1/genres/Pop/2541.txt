Go get your ribbon box Go get your wounded heart Seeing spiders I'm told they never lie Go get your brother love Go get your losing head Seeing fire I'm told it never burns I want it all I pull you back I want it all Cry baby cry baby cry Soaking down your face Cry baby cry baby and you can't understand how I could just kill a man No to your letters love No to unsturdy hands Sleeping eyes I'm told they never lie No to your key of rust No to your raging words Sleeping tires I'm told they never drive If I wanted to stay you won't stand in my way But I'm choosing to leave with your heart on my sleeve It feels too good without you
