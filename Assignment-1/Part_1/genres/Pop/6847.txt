Far away the sky is turning grey Although the sun is shining above right here No I won't let the fish eat you And of course I know they wouldn't do But you're too little to understand that Say who on earth can guide us Help us stear this boat on shore The stream might drag us under Soon we'll hit the waterfall Say who on earth can save us From the thunder in our hearts I swear to you no matter what We'll never be apart far away There is a clear new day But it's gonna rain first in our heads Let's take the car down the highway And park it down by the bay Dip our toes into the water Say who on earth can guide us Through these misty curving roads And lay their hands upon our shoulders Point out where to go Say who on earth can save us From the thunder in our hearts I swear to you no matter what They won't tear us apart Who eavesdropped behind my chandeliers The trolls have all popped out Everything is here Easy peasy lemon time Tout va bien cherie I'm a concubine I'm a concubine
