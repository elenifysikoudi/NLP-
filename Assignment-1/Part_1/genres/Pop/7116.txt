There is something Exciting about leavin everything behind There is something Deep and pulling leavin everything behind Something about having everything You think you'll ever need Sitting in the seat next to you And I watch Another white dash another white dash Another white dash fly beside us And I watch Another white dash another white dash Another white dash fly beneath us Away away There is yelling of an engine A constant rattling door There is serious deep and mumbles A conversation I'm not in Flickering lights shadows of trees Makes me blink my eyes makes the land Appear like a really old movie And I watch Another white dash another white dash Another white dash fly beside us And I watch Another white dash another white dash Another white dash fly beneath us Ooh away away I got a heart full of rubber bands That keep getting caught on things And I count Another white dash another white dash Another white dash I drift off at eighty something And I count Another white dash another white dash Another white dash Out of time with the music Another white dash another white dash Another white dash fly beside us And I count Another white dash another white dash Another white dash fly beneath us There is something Exciting about leavin everything behind There is something Deep and pulling leavin everything behind Something about having everything You think you'll ever need Sitting in the seat next to you
