Last night I dream that you were beside me It seems so real that I cried When you've touched me You're my angel And you've given me wings And I fly away with you wherever you go Cause you filled my heart and you captured my soul And baby i want you to know CHORUS If there's one thing in this world that I know is true It's the love that I feel when I'm thinking of you No ocean or mountain can keep us apart Coz no one can take away someone who lives in your heart All the hopes and the dreams are alive I'll carry you with me through distance and time Nothing in this world can keep us apart Coz no one can take away someone who lives in your heart And I know there's a million stars between us But that won't stop my longing To hold you and to kiss you How I love you And I'll find my way to you wherever you are Coz you're in my soul and you've got my heart And your love will carry me on CHORUS If there's one thing in this world that I know is true It's the love that I feel when I'm thinking of you No ocean or mountain can keep us apart Coz no one can take away someone who lives in your heart All the hopes and the dreams are alive I'll carry you with me through distance and time Nothing in this world can keep us apart Coz no one can take away someone who lives in your heart Here in my arms were you should be Cause your love that makes me believe That nothing or no one can tear us apart cause baby your in my heart CHORUS If there's one thing in this world that I know is true It's the love that I feel when I'm thinking of you No ocean or mountain can keep us apart Coz no one can take away someone who lives in your heart All the hopes and the dreams are alive I'll carry you with me through distance and time Nothing in this world can keep us apart Coz no one can take away someone who lives in your heart
