You lie you lie in consequence You stay as part of sympathy Can it be you'd break If the thoughts and words collide You might cry to fate This tension is part of me This chemistry All that I have ever known Is in pieces of light in the shadows You take you take this honesty this symmetry And you wait you wait for suffering Can it be that you stay When thoughts and worlds collide You might hide but you take You can take this whole of me Can it be All that I have ever known Is in pieces of light in the shadows It's like I think I was immune To the pieces of me in the sun and in the shadow Tonight the wounded heart's deafening You wait for all of these things I believe But you live fear won't change a word destiny But you rain reign over my heart and All that I have ever known Is in pieces of blue in the shadows It's like I think I was immune To the pieces of me in the sun and in the shadow Tonight the wounded heart's deafening You live here you won't change a word So just believe
