I threw your picture in the fire I watched you melt away You turned to smoke you burned my eyes But I couldn't escape My love for you remains So why was I afraid When you were next to me Why didn't I tell you You were so good to me Why didn't I just take back everything I said to you And take back everything I put you through Why didn't I tell you They said we never would survive And I believed the lies And then their words were verified When I replaced my heart for your demise But you were always on the side When you were next to me Why didn't I tell you You were so good to me Why didn't I just take back everything I said to you And take back everything I put you through Why didn't I tell you I love the way you understand The way you love The way you were when no one was looking That you were beautiful and you were worth it all You were everything I need You captured my attention Did I mention I think you're beautiful darling If I could tell you now I'd tell you how the world is dark now that you're missing Now that you're missing When you were next to me Why didn't I tell you You were so good to me And why didn't I just take back everything I said to you And take back everything I put you through Why didn't I tell you I love the way you understand The way you love The way you were Why didn't I tell you That you were beautiful And you were worth it all So why didn't I tell you You captured my attention did I mention So why didn't I tell you That you were beautiful That you were worth it all So why didn't I tell you If I could tell you now I'd say I love you
