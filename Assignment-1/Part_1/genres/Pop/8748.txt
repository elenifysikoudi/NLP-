When I touch you there is no more hurting We're more than lovers freezing time Bound together bodies resonating Getting louder as we climb 'Cause you and me We break the laws of gravity And I I believe You've been waiting for too long so give in to your fantasy I want you you burn into me Your taste runs through my mouth I want you lost in ecstasy You shiver as I'm going down down You move like honey as you brush against me Your body language sends you off You whisper closely baby wont you hold me So I'll never let you go 'Cause you cause you and me and me We break the laws of gravity And I I believe You've been waiting for too long so give in to your fantasy I want you you burn into me Your taste runs through my mouth I want you lost in ecstasy You shiver as I'm going down All I all I all I feel is you I want you you burn into me Your taste runs through my mouth through my mouth I want you lost in ecstasy You shiver as I'm going down I want you you burn into me Your taste runs through my mouth I want you lost in ecstasy You shiver as I'm going down I want you you burn into me Your taste runs through my mouth through my mouth I want you lost in ecstasy You shiver as I'm going down All I all I all I feel is you I want you I need you I feel you
