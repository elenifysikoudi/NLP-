Have I not been fooled again I know I must have I thought such joy could never end I thought I would Keep you with me Eternally Now I turn a painful red When people pass me Avert my eyes and drop my head Afraid they might See what I see My destiny I just want the rain to come To console me to pour over me There's nothing like a rainstorm To wash away the rain My crying in vain Autumn leaves and butterflies When winter's due They all turn weak they all just die In multitudes Invisible Nothing at all My oh my the wind did turn I lie awake in bed I sweat I toss I burn With agony This emptiness It's so meaningless I just want the rain to come To console me to pour over me They say there's nothing like a rainstorm To wash away the rain I just want the rain to come To dissolve me to pour over me You know they say there's nothing like a rainstorm To wash away the rain My crying in vain My crying in vain Have I not been fooled again
