"The harbor lights were shining the moon was at its high The captain said ""Thank God we're home we've drunk the barrels dry"" The mizzen mast was shaken and the lanterns all burned low I'd never thought we'd make it but we've twenty leagues to go So blow you southern trades and guide me safely to the shore I'll never ever gonna sail the seven seas no more I don't want to miss the sand in my hair The roll of the tide and the salt in the air Deep inside it's true I'm a home lovin man comin on home to you I don't want to miss the wind in my eyes The shimmerin light when the seagull flies Lo I've traveled far I'm a home loving man home is where you are The crowd upon the quayside their faces long and drawn Are suddenly awakened as we sail in on the dawn The wives the sons the lovers who never gave up hope All breathe a sigh together as they reach to catch the rope God bless you southern trades you got me safely back this time Oh you'll never have the need again to save this soul of mine I don't want to miss the sand in my hair The roll of the tide and the salt in the air Deep inside it's true I'm a home lovin man comin on home to you I don't want to miss the wind in my eyes The shimmerin light when the seagull flies Lo I've traveled far I'm a home loving man home is where you are"
