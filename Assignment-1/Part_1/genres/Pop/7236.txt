close your eyes and drive until the feeling's gone wake up so far away you can't remember where you just came from you towed the line you towed the line one to many times and now they're the ones left behind You're not the one to say what you're feeling right now and I'm not the one to carry on without the likes of you Because i can't forget what we both have been through plan your escape and climb out your window we'll be done by sun rise so close your eyes and drive and if i ever let them down i wish that i'd care more than i do now somethings just matter to me more somethings just matter to me more i'll leave my light in my bedroom burning bright to let you know that tonight is the night Your're not the one to say what your feeling right now and I'm not the one to carry on without the likes of you Because i can't forget what we both have been through plan your escape and climb out your window we'll be done by sun rise so close your eyes and drive a few pints of poetry to take the ground beneath my feet we're falling fast than this heat and toss and turning while you sleep it's flooding through your ever word escapes your teeth and goes unheard its flooding through your every word escapes your teeth and goes unheard You're not the one to say what you're feeling right now and I'm not the one to carry on without the likes of you Because i can't forget what we both have been through plan your escape and climb out your window we'll be done by sun rise so close your eyes and drive
