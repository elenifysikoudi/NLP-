Cross her off your short list My blood is a red winged bird The way will be lit by the bridges we burn oh And come tornado carry my away from the croft Ruffle my hair bear my body aloft oh As the cutlass came down on a Saturday night Left an unplanted field left my daughter and wife Called away into service for a clerical life Left an unplanted field left my daughter and wife Thought I was a sad boy Now I know I know I know I was wrong Since you came alone I can see how content I had been It'll drive a man crazy to age from the outside in But I have a plan it's a trick with the prick of a pin As the cutlass came down on a Saturday night Left an unplanted field left my daughter and wife Called away into service for a clerical life Left an unplanted field left my daughter and wife
