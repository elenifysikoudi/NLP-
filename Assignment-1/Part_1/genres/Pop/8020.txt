How wonderful to know How wonderful to know How wonderful to know you really love me How wonderful to know you really care How beautiful to feel my arms around you Kissing your eyes hearing your sighs touching your hair How wonderful to share sunshine and laughter To fils my empty heart with love divine To live this life with you and hereafter How wonderful to know that you are mine How wonderful to know you really love me How wonderful to know that you are mine
