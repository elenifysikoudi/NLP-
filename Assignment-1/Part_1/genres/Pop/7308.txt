You think you know it all Just wait and see how you got it got it wrong The days are dead and gone Where you can push and pull me along No no more I'll push harder don't you bother Try your best You can't destroy me I'll go farther I'll get stronger What I got you can't control Chorus You say I'm breaking again This time I won't even bend Not giving in I'm indestructible You say you're under my skin I'm not even listening You'll never win I'm indestructible Try to ruin everything But I'm not letting you get to get to me get to me oh no Here's what I guarantee Eventually you'll be weakening you're weakening I'll push harder don't you bother Try your best You can't destroy me I'll go farther I'll get stronger What I got you can't control no Chorus Here we go Look in my eyes Here we go I'm not afraid to fight Come a little closer and see what's keeping me alive Give it up Without a doubt Give it up You're going down Don't you see that you can't mess with me I'll push harder don't you bother Try your best You can't destroy me I'll go farther I'll get stronger What I got you can't control I'll push harder don't you bother Try your best You can't destory me I'll go farther I'll get stronger What I got you can't control no Chorus Indestructible
