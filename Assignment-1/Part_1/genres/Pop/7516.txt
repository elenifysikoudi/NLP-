You're as cold as ice and I realize That I'm loosing you girl what can I do I can see your eyes and they show the lies That you hide inside oh that can't be right Why don't you tell me you don't wanna see me no more Are you afraid that my cryin would make you unsure It's been paradise now I see that guy Foolin round with you VVhat you're tryin to do If you wanna go you don't need to show all those sexy ways Girl I hate those games You're driftin away and it looks like you loosing control I knew you before and you're never been actin so cold Night after night I've been waitin for you Night after night in my room Night after night I don't know what to do Night after night all alone And the picture of you reminds me of times we shared And I can't understand why you're treatin me oh so bad Why can't you see that you're loosing The game that you play Can't you imagine the prize that you might have to pay When you're cold as ice Don't you realize that you're loosing me Baby can't you see Girl your Iyin eyes are just a weak disguise For your fantasy that you hide from me You're driftin away Night after night I've been waitin for you And the picutre of you reminds me of times we shared Night after night I've been waitin for you
