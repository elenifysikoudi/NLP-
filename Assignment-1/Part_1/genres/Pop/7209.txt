High above the roof tops Higher than the milky way Slipping through the hour glass Shooting up the desert plain You are one life older than before But you can't stop the chill Now you're falling in slow motion Though the air is still If you close your eyes than I can take you all the way Let me close your eyes and I will take it all the way You are on the outside Hands upon the window sill I am on the inside Carving up the hunters kill If you close your eyes than I can take you all the way Let me close your eyes and I will take it all the way Cruising on a missile Cruising on a desert plain Wading through a minefield Wading through the monsoon rain Surfing on an oil spill Surfing on a perfect wave Porn upon the airwaves Rituals of the mating game If you close your eyes than I can take you all the way Let me close your eyes and I will take it all the way
