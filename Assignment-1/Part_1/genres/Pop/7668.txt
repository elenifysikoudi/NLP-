I could kiss you for hours Who'd have thought I'd be in your mouth Loud and clear Harder Do you feel it with me Harder How am I certain to fit All of your needs Master of all of your needs I could kiss you for hours And not miss a thing Read my lips now I could kiss you for hours The feeling you bring Shaped deep in oh I could kiss you for hours How would you like it if my lips touched yours And they stayed close baby til the stars fade out How would you like it if I sip before I bite But it wasn't too hard so it felt alright How would you like it if I held you in my arms Round of your bed be a substitute for Harder Do you feel it with me Harder How am I certain to fit All of your needs Master of all of your needs I could kiss you for hours And not miss a thing Read my lips now I could kiss you for hours The feeling you bring Shaped deep in oh I could kiss you for hours heaven under the ground Sweetest thing a girl like me likes Found I could kiss you for hours In the higher world of your own A lone wolf Grow I could kiss you for hours And not miss a thing Read my lips now I could kiss you for hours The feeling you bring Shaped deep in oh I could kiss you for hours I could kiss you for hours
