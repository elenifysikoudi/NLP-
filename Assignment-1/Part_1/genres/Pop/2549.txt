"Saw you the other day you said my hair was brown and long I said I wasn't sure why I take time to talk to ya boy I saw her call your phone I secretly looked but you knew all along And Blue Birds didn't sing so replace my tears with a ring Go the distance if you please 'Cause your touches are a tease and if you really want me Mister please don't waste my time Wasn't made to hear you whine Here it comes Boy I tell you A E I O U losers with their fiction A E I O U must be an addiction A E I O U you say ""I see myself in you "" But you ain't hittin nothin with your woe You called me the other day you said my head was sweet yet cruel I laughed the whole way through don't you see the problem is you I tried to shop for shoes you raped my tired head for answers Chased me down the street I still don't think the problem is me Go the distance if you please 'Cause your touches are a tease and if you really Want me Mister please don't waste my time Wasn't made to hear you whine Here it comes boy I tell you A E I O U losers with their fiction A E I O U must be an addiction A E I O U you say ""I see myself in you "" But you ain't hittin nothin with your woe"
