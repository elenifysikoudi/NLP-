When the boy in your arms Is the boy in your heart Then you've got everything When you're holding the dream You've been dreaming you'd hold You're as rich as a king So hold him tight And never let him go Day and night Let him know you love him so With the love of your life Spend a life time of love Make him yours for ever more So hold him tight And never let him go Day and night Let him know you love him so With the love of your life Spend a life time of love Make him yours for ever more Make him yours for ever more
