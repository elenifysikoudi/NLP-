Youve got a friend in me Youve got a friend in me When the road looks rough ahead And youre miles and miles from your nice warm bed You just remember what your old pal said Boy youve got a friend in me Yeah youve got a friend in me Youve got a friend in me Youve got a friend in me Youve got troubles well Ive got em too There isnt anything I wouldnt do for you We stick together and we see it through Cause youve got a friend in me Yeah youve got a friend in me Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am Bigger and stronger too maybe But none of them will ever love you The way I do Its me and you boy And as the years go by Our friendship will never die Youre gonna see Its our destiny Youve got a friend in me Oh boy Yeah youve got a friend in me Thats right Yeah youve got a friend in me
