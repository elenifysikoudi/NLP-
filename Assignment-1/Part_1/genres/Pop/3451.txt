I thought I knew you Better than I knew myself girl I thought I found you Hiding in the strength that's in your eyes But now I see you Burning all the bridges in your world Now I feel you Sinking in the quicksand of your lies Can't you see that you're slipping away Can't you hear what I'm trying to say You're better than that Better than that Stronger than that You're worth much more You're better than that And you can turn back What's tried is torn Better than that Stronger than that You're worth much more I'm telling you its killing you It's drowning you it's spilling you over What's tried is torn I thought you knew how To chase away the demons of blind trust I thought you knew now It's all about temptation Changed by choice But girl you're crazy You're hanging onto reasons Turned to rust You're eyes are hazy You've gone and lost the velvet In your voice Can't you see that you're slipping away Can't you hear what I'm trying to say You're better than that I told you once I told you twice I told you baby Now there's nothing more to say I'm missing the girl I knew While kissing the broken you But it's not up to me So don't back face up to the facts And you can turn back You're better than that Better than that stronger than that Wiser than that bigger than that You're better than the devil in you Tellin you how pulling you down Spilling you but it's up to you
