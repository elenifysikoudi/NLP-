If you told me all about your sorrows I'd tell you about a cure If you told me you can't fight the battle There's a baby boy who won the war The war was won by a baby boy Alleluia we can sing it Alleluia heaven's ringing Alleluia Endless hope and relentless joy started with a baby boy Oh before that silent night No savior and no jesus christ The world cried out so desperately And the baby boy was the reply Yes heaven's reply was a baby boy Alleluia we can sing it Alleluia heaven's ringing Alleluia Endless hope and relentless joy started with a baby boy See the king is coming down And he's here without a crown The baby boy without a bed Giving life back to the dead And hear the angels shout it out As the people come and bow Unexpected majesty Alleluia what a king Alleluia we can sing it Alleluia heaven's ringing Alleluia Endless hope and relentless joy started with a baby boy Alleluia we can sing it Alleluia yeah heaven's ringing Alleluia Endless hope and relentless joy started with a baby boy
