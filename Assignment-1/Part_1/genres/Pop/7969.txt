So rare so rare So rare so rare So rare you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair Sweet as a breath of air Fresh with the morning dew So rare you're like the sparkle of old champagne Orchids in cellophane Couldn't compare to you You are perfection doo do wa you're my idea doo doo wa Of angels singing doo doo wa the Ave Maria doo doo wa For you're an angel doo doo wa I breathe and live you doo doo a With every beat of the heart that I give you So rare this is a heaven on earth we share Caring the way we care Ours is a love so rare so rare so rare So rare so rare You are perfection you're my idea Of angels singing the Ave Maria For you're an angel I breathe and live you With every beat of the heart that I give you So rare so rare this is a heaven on earth we share so rare Caring the way we care so rare Ours is a love so rare so rare so rare So rare so rare
