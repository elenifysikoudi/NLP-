Oh my love this is the beginning Open up your eyes so you don't miss it We can stand on top of what we're building Oh to see right where we are heading But in the shadows we'll see nothing I'm a strong believer In you my love forever I'll open up the windows and let the light in We'll break out of the darkness and out of our skin We'll rest in what we don't know And speak of what we hope Oh my love why are you still running Away from what you've always wanted We can make our home just like Eden And spend our days living like we're children Let's fight what love's already won I'm a strong believer In you my love forever I'll open up the windows and let the light in We'll break out of the darkness and out of our skin We'll rest in what we don't know And speak of what we hope Here's to holding nothing back And to finally having what I've always lacked I'm a strong believer In you my love forever I'll open up the windows and let the light in We'll break out of the darkness and out of our skin We'll rest in what we don't know And speak of what we hope Oh my love this is the beginning
