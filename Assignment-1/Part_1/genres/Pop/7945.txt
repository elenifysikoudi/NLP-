My world is like a river as dark as it is deep Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memory Sweet memories Sweet memories Mmm She slipped into the silence of my dreams again last night Wandering from room to room she's turning on each light Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea And I'm swept away from sadness clinging to her memory Sweet memories Sweet memories Mmm
