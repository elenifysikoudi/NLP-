From the moment that we met I knew that we would connect Your eyes had told me that somehow We shared a history Feeling fearless I took a chance Couldn't let the moment pass I felt that fate had played a hand And brought you here to me But happiness can be short lived And pain can bring you to your knees Don't think that I'll get over you Don't know if I can make it through My darkest days without you in my life and i Don't think that I can face the pain I'll never see your face again I close my eyes and wonder when Will it ever end Get as close as we could be Felt that you could see through me You read my mind you knew my life Became a part of me Took for granted precious time Thought we had it on our side By some cruel twist of fate I had to watch you fade away
