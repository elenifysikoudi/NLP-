I must have left it on the table Of the chair Not sure I didn't feel it it was painless Oh dear I guess I'm just a little careless I'll confess When the music's on Everything else gets lost I think I like it I think I like it I think I'd like my soul back I think I like it I think I like it I think I'd like my sould back Too busy looking for the good side Of the ball To dance I spun around and saw you leaving That's weird I thought I saw you by the punch bowl I'll confess I had no glasses on You could have been anyone I think I like it I think I like it I think I'd like my soul back I think I like it I think I like it I think I'd like my soul back And only now I find I lost it At all Some how You think you're fine Until you land On stones And then you try to think what pushed you I'll confess I'm a mess inside All my fun fell out I think I'd like my sould back I think I like it I think I like it I think I'd like my soul back I think I like it I think I like it I think I'd like my soul back
