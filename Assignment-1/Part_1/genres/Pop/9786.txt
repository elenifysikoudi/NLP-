This is how it ends never meant to hurt you I'm a pretty mess and I don't deserve you I ran out of time and second chances Sorry couldn't build your white picket fences And I I I only got myself to blame Cause every time I see you it's like all I am is see through We were everything I know it don't wanna miss it record it I adore you I adore I adore you I adore I adore you I adore I adore you I adore The falling out was easy but I hate that you don't need me And it gets so hard to speak every time you get to me Cause I adore you I adore I adore you I adore I adore you I adore I adore you I adore Everybody says that you're doin fine now Cruisin for a thrill like I wouldn't find out When you turn it back do you ever wonder If we could have tomorrow in technicolor And I I I got so much left to say And no o o o o o can't you see it I adore you No no o o o o o you're mi i ine I adore you
