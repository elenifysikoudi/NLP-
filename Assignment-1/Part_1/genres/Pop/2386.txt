"Take a little bit of this here And a sip of this ""Not so fast"" Too early in the evening still a baby We should make a date to drink We make some friends no spends We run into some crazies I know that you have desires And some other matters that you require And you're tired so let's be liars Do you really wanna be somebody So just call and say ""Hey "" Would you like to hop a gate to the other world Well yeah absolutely You don't wanna be somebody So just call and say ""Hey "" Would you like to hop a gate to the other world Well yeah absolutely Take a minute if you need to breathe As a girl age 17 running down the avenue avenue And your eyes got watery from all the hollering Morning til the afternoon afternoon And know it's never better All tomorrows parties gonna be better so whatever whatev's Do you really wanna be somebody So just call and say ""Hey "" Would you like to hop a gate to the other world Well yeah absolutely You don't wanna be somebody So just call and say ""Hey "" Would you like to hop a gate to the other world Well yeah absolutely"
