And it's open For distraction You found all the words you need Well I found nothing I just grumble 'cause I don't know what I feel The moral to the story goes Never leave your heart Never leave your heart alone Run for shelter An umbrella Fights the rain but not the wind And I'd be silly To start preaching 'cause I don't know which point to make The moral to the story goes Never leave your heart In a box Locked up With cold cold ice Never leave your heart Never leave your heart alone Am I frozen But it's summer Is that rain or is that me Yes I'm melting Please be happy One day soon We might just swim The moral to the story goes Never leave your heart In a box Locked up with cold cold ice Never leave your heart Never leave your heart Never leave your heart alone
