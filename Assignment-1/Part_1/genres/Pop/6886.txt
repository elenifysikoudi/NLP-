One kiss one little sigh That's all you gave me When you said goodbye But someday baby someday darling You're gonna miss me Long gone is your caress And with it all my happiness But someday baby someday darling You're gonna miss me Oh oh oh yes One of these nights You'll wake up crying But I won't be there to comfort you You'll turn on the light But you'll go on crying 'Cause only my true love Can chase away your blues Oh yes you're gonna learn I'm not the only one Whose heart will burn 'Cause someday baby someday darling You're gonna miss me Miss me miss me miss me Someday baby someday darling You're gonna miss me Oh oh oh oh oh yeah
