I'm on the outside lookin in But I like it this way Here on the outside lookin in I see the games that they play I'm on the outside lookin in But I don't really care Here in the outside lookin in 'Long as I get my share You know that I'll take my share When it's late at night They blow out the light And although they might be sleein If they hear a sound I may be around And they know I could be creepin creepin creepin They must be aware If they think I'm there it's a very scary feelin Lyin in their beds Running through their heads Is one thought what is he stealin I'm on the outside lookin in But I like it this way Here on the outside lookin in I see the games that they play I'm on the outside lookin in But I don't really care Here in the outside lookin in 'Long as I get my share You know that I'll take my share I can hear then tell I'm a hound of hell As they get the smell of danger As I'm coming near I can taste their fear Of the dark and deadly stranger They know who I am I don't give a damn I could lead ev'ry lamb to the slaughter So be on your guard For my calling card And be sure to lock up your daughters They keep us outside lookin in My sister and me And if we're outside lookin in That's the way it will be We're on the outside lookin in But we don't really care Here on the outside lookin in 'Long as we get our share You know that we'll take our share We're on the outside lookin in We're on the outside lookin in We're on the outside lookin in
