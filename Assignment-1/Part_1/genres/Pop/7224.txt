In the idle light of a fading day There's a past i lost One i gave away One i used to know Caught in the dust of a desert plain Waiting For the rains to fall It's something that i feel rain falls Something that i feel when rain falls More than a world away It's always here inside In all that has overgrown Almost underground Could never be all erased Only lost and found One i left behind Caught in the dust of a desert plain Waiting For the rains to come It's something that i feel rain falls Something that i feel when rain falls More than a world away It's always here inside
