In a neat little town they call Belfast Apprentice to trade I was bound And many an hour sweet happiness I spent in that neat little town Till a sad misfortune came over me Which caused me to stray from this land Far away from me friends and relations Betrayed by the black velvet band I took a stroll with that pretty fair maid When a gentleman passes me by I knew that she had the doing in him By that look in her rovish black eye A gold watch she took from his pocket And placed it right into my hand The very next thing I said was Bad luck to the black velvet band Her eyes they shown like diamonds I thought her the queen of the land And her hair hung over her shoulder Tied up with a black velvet band Before the judge and the jury Next morning I had to appear The judge he said to me Young lad your case it is proven clear We'll go seven years penal servitude And take you away from this land Far away from me friends and relations Betrayed by the black velvet band Her eyes they shown like diamonds I thought her the queen of the land And her hair hung over her shoulder Tied up with a black velvet band So come all ye jolly young fellas Who warning take by me When you are out in the town me lads Be aware of them pretty colleens For they'll feed you with strong drink me lads Till you are unable to stand And the very next thing you know is that You've landed in Van Diemen's land Her eyes they shown like diamonds I thought her the queen of the land And her hair hung over her shoulder Tied up with a black velvet band Her eyes they shown like diamonds I thought her the queen of the land And her hair hung over her shoulder Tied up with a black velvet band
