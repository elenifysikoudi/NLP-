Brick by brick I built a hundred feet tall All these walls are up higher than I thought Let my secret out I want them to fall Bars and barricades this ain't what I want Like a prisoner like a prisoner With these eyes of steel I'm living like a prisoner You know I close the door yeah I close the door Yeah I did it cause I didn't wanna hurt no more They say that the armor makes you strong I might be safe but I'm all alone Been hiding from the light for way too long Tell me You can break this heart of stone Tell me You can break it I need You to break it Tell me You can break this heart of stone Tell me You can break it I need You to break it Tell me You can break this heart of stone Only you can break it Only you can break it Only you can break it break it Only you can break it Only you can break it Only you can break it break it Crash like broken glass shattered on the floor Finally a victory I've never felt before Now the gates are open Imma run right through that door I'm never going back to the chains I wore before Like a prisoner like a prisoner With these eyes of steel I'm living like a prisoner You know I closed the door yeah I closed the door Yeah I did it cause I didn't wanna hurt no more They say that the armor makes you strong I might be safe but I'm all alone Been hiding from the light for way too long Tell me you can break this heart of stone Tell me you can break it I need you to break it Tell me you can break this heart of stone Tell me you can break it I need you to break it Tell me you can break this heart of stone Only you can break it Only you can break it Only only you can break it Yeah Only you can break it Only you can break it Only you Only you can break it break it Only only you can break it Only you can break it Only you can break it Yeah Only you can break it break it I feel you close You tryna get closer I run away but you got devotion Every day You are pursuing me But I know that everybody can see But I'm pushing everybody away I push you away cause I'm afraid Afraid that my heart might get broken again I'm afraid that you're gonna see all of my sin Now let's sit back and imagine for a second Life ain't been a bed of roses for the record Heartbreak after heartbreak what's next Heartache after heartache I'm stressed With you is where my heart belongs You're the reason I'm writing this song So I give it over my heart of stone Take it and break it and make it your home They say that the armor makes you strong I might be safe but I'm all alone all alone Been hiding from the light for way too long for way too long Tell me you can break this heart of stone Tell me you can break it I need you to break it Tell me you can break this heart of stone Tell me you can break it I need you to break it Tell me you can break this heart of stone
