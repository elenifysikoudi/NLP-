It was springtime and we were young now that's when we just begun see i remember she'd smile so bright and now she's a spaceship every night pre chorus and she's running she's running so you can't find her cause she's just not in there i'll keep trying keep fighting cause i won't lose her i know she still cares chorus so cross your fingers you don't know what you've got into see in the dark she'll break your heart and move on right through so cross your fingers close the door and she'll continue see in the dark she'll break your heart and move on right through verse 2 she's freezing cold and all alone so far away from a happy home pre chorus and she's running she's running so you can't find her cause she's just not in there i'll keep trying keep fighting cause i won't lose her i know she still cares chorus so cross your fingers you don't know what you've got into see in the dark she'll break your heart and move on right through so cross your fingers close the door and she'll continue see in the dark she'll break your heart and move on right through move on right through she's running she's running so you can't find her cause she's just not in there i'll keep trying keep fighting cause i won't lose her i know she still cares so cross your fingers you don't know what you've got into see in the dark she'll break your heart and move on right through so cross your fingers close the door and she'll continue see in the dark she'll break your heart and move on right through
