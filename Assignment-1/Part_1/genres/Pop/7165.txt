Is it wrong to be alone An adventure of my own A celebration of myself and me Discovering what I can be The half a couple fantasy Oh luck is on my side I celebrate my life Don't try to come Don't pin me down with vows and flowers I was brought up I've been told That a husband is the goal What connotations in these loaded words A spinster and a bachelor I am whole all by myself I don't need nobody else Father ruler king computer Father ruler king computer Father ruler king computer Hello destiny is this what you want from me Don't anybody try to stop me Oh luck is on my side I celebrate my life Don't try to come Don't pin me down Don't pin me down
