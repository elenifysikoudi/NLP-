So see the leaves fall to the ground And see then lyin all around Cause still I can't see you And there's the wind that plays in the air Flying around how it does not care still I can't see you And the seasons pass away And I still sit here lonely each and every day Wondering what's gone wrong Cause I don't remember seasons lasting oh so long Oh so long And I still can't see you And I still can't see you And I still can't see you Lauren and I Lauren and I I'm dreaming every night I'm searching every day I had her in my sights and let her slip away And there's the stars way in the sky leading my way and i don't know where or why still I can't see you And when my backs against the wall I see a reason for it all but still I can't see you I'm dreaming every night I'm searching every day I had her in my sights and let her slip away And I still can't see you And I still can't see you And I still can't see you Lauren and I Lauren and I
