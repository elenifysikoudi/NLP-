Another day lost in this veil of gray Fading into night It's like I'm blind it's like I'm paralyzed Don't feel like I'm alive Then you appeared through the rain Chased all my clouds away The day I found your love was the day life began The first time I smelled a flower the first time I felt the breeze The first time I saw a rainbow heard a melody Could never understand beauty until I held your hand The day I found your love was the day life began Never knew why people liked butterflies Or watched the setting sun To stare at the sky seemed like a waste of time Until I found the one Who opened my eyes made me see All the beauty surrounding me The day I found your love was the day life began The first time I smelled a flower the first time I felt the breeze The first time I saw a rainbow heard a melody Could never understand beauty till I held your hand The day I found your love was the day life began Were like a new creation I'm Adam you be Eve Don't eat no dirty apples stay right here with me You gave me breath again like the sunlight gives life to plants The day I found your love was the day love began
