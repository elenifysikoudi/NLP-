Once there was time It lay in front of me With tendrils and curves of what was yet to be Afraid of the beast not in the least A heart for a brain and lips sweet again with the taste of life Slumber through the years where hurt stings blinking tears and dark hides my skin from the sun and yet again Its those who dare to really get in that feed me with their eyes Those who dare to really get in that feed me with their smile But it's no never enough It could burn like white light but it's not enough It can burn like white light it's never enough Now there is time to lay in blame with me and despite all I write you live well It seems to me Those who dare to really get in they feed me with their eyes Its those who dare to really get in that feed me with their smile But it's no never enough It can burn like fire still its not enough No it's not it's not enough It can burn like fire its never enough
