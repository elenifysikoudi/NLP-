Im debating with my cigarettes Im young and I am ignorant been living life to that extent oh well Barefoot in your summer dress your mouths open your hairs a mess the sun is shining nonetheless oh well Counting out the blades of grass Levis jeans and skipping class let bygones be bygones sometimes you got to keep moving on And if you want to I can come back for you Taking pictures of the emptiness was here one day then gone the next Yeah if you try just try a little harder Laughing off the loneliness just say the word you know Ill be there Were cranking up the radio theres nowhere that I wouldnt go the only one I truly know is you Lost in one more late night drive cant tell how much I feel alive just sit around and waste my time with you Counting out the blades of grass Levis jeans and and skipping class Let bygones be bygones sometimes you got to keep moving on And if you want to I can come back for you Taking pictures of the emptiness was here one day then gone the next Yeah if you try just try a little harder Laughing off the loneliness just say the word you know Ill be there
