I like the way that You carry yourself I haven't seen that In nobody else When you walk in a room It's all eyes on you baby From head to toe You look so good Something about you Shouts a command Could it be the way you talk Or the way that you stand Some kind of magnet Pulls me to you I won't resist you no Cos I don't think I could If I could have my own way I wouldn't need a whole day If I could have my own way I know that we'd go all the way I like the way You speak to me Your sexy voice Does things to me Can't help but notice The things you do baby I hate to say it But I'm hooked on you I want to get closer Closer to you I wanna feel your love Come flowing through I wanna take over Take over your heart Forever together Never apart If I could have my own way I wouldn't need a whole day If I could have my own way I know that we'd go all the way
