I think you ought to know I think we've lost control dear Whatever turned you on You put it up your nose dear And though the feeling was sublime I think we re running out of time cause when you found it you'd fix it Then lose it and then you'd go Will you be long will you be long dear Will you be long I'm waiting No sleep at all carry me home No sleep at all carry me home won't you take me there I serenade the walls Young people have it all dear And surely life is a gas We never had it bad dear Oh was it pointless from the start Or did we cultivate the arts I swim in circles in puddles in trouble and then I go Will I be long will I be long dear Will I be strong you're waiting No sleep at all carry me home No sleep at all carry me home won't you take me here I don't feel good inside I don't feel good inside My darling don't you cry home home
