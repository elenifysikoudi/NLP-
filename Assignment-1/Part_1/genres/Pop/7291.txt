I wake up to another day I don't know if I can face All the fears that is tearing me down Yea I'm trying to be brave But I'm afraid about to fade I wanna stand but I don't know how I look up and all I see is Your love holding me When I feel like giving up When my heart is hurt too much Feels like I've reached the end No I won't turn and run This battle will be won When I've done all I can I stand stand stand I stand stand stand Some days I lose my place It's a fight to keep my faith But You are with me I am not alone no But all around my work is late Toss like an ocean wave You are my rock and the storm clouds blow I look up and all I see is Your love holding me When I feel like giving up When my heart is hurt too much Feels like I've reached the end No I won't turn and run This battle will be won When I've done all I can I stand stand stand I stand stand stand On Your promise I will stand Oh look the ground is sinking sand On Your promise I will stand Oh look the ground is sinking sand Sinking sand oh who woooh It's sinking sinking yea ye When I feel like giving up When my heart is hurt too much Feels like I've reached the end No I won't turn and run This battle will be won yea yea So I'll stand stand stand I stand stand I'll stand stand stand
