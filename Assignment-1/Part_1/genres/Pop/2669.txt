I watch minutes grow to hours and how seasons build the ages Every winter dies in sunlight only to be born again And the rainfall feeds the forests while the lightning strikes the trees Turning giants into dust fertile ashes on the ground I see them going down to the water Where they embrace the silent waves Slowly they're swallowed by the water And their breath ascending to the sky I see them now floating in the water Carried away carried away I see wasteland turn into gardens watching oceans giving birth To fragile little creatures born to grow and multiply And the children of the children of the firstborn claims the land Building fences for protection from their brothers greedy grasp I watch kingdoms rise and crumble and the nations come and go Only new names for the same things once the limit has been reached Now I see them lose their interest in the deeds that have been done And the wisdom that's been found as they return to whence they came
