Uh gina g You get me started V I g Get me started I was moving along in the city life Wasn't looking for love just trying to be myself Without the pressure of someone else Nothing would have convinced me that I would fall Not from where I was standing no I was positive That I just wasn't interested Didn't know it was coming until it was too late And like a super hero you found me You rescued me 'Cause when I get to be next to you Ya get to me yes you do I get to see what's for my eyes only Shake whenever I'm next to you My body gets what to do Whatever you think will get me started When I get to be next to you Ya get to me yes you do And finally you can feel my heart too You get me started Kissing you is like candy ooh delicious Lucky I didn't need some genie and three wishes 'Cause suddenly you were standing there Didn't know it was coming until it was too late And like a super hero you found me You rescued me 'Cause when I get to be next to you Ya get to me yes you do I get to see what's for my eyes only Shake whenever I'm next to you My body gets what to do Whatever you think will get me started When I get to be next to you Ya get to me yes you do And finally you can feel my heart too You get me started Uh next to you How bout next to me I'm in gina's world I'm the next u p Come and take these to the next room On a girl and 3 2 1 Ya get me started Show me how you dumb out Let's get retarded Haha get this freaker started And I'm on you let me close your half in How about after the t girl meet me half way Call me the superman I'm down with role play And I'll fly you to the heights Uh lois lane When you get to be next to me I get to you yes I do You get to see what's for your eyes only Something in me wants to try And run and hide away but I will stay here Because like the sky and in love it goes on and on And on and on and on You get me started And on and on You get me started And on and on You get me started And on and on You get me started And on and on 'Cause when I get to be next to you Ya get to me yes you do I get to see what's for my eyes only Shake whenever I'm next to you My body gets what to do Whatever you think will get me started When I get to be next to you Ya get to me yes you do And finally you can feel my heart too You get me started You get me started
