"Knew you were born under a waxing moon Wide eyed and waiting for most the view Sharper than moonlight All is one ""Heaven awaits you now hope you find our door"" Eyes pressed tightly waltz with stars The sweeter now must move on Your words are so beguiling all is right this ""Heaven and constancy"" I hope you learned Can I hold you in pages adore you your words they have power over me I have dreamed of your majesty The pain of this illusion comforts me it reminds me of how well I was the next to leave earching for a heart as ripe as your smile I have left you here hope you hide me Can hold you in pages I adore you these words they cast this feeling over me Can I know you in pages enthrall you in words that have this power over me"
