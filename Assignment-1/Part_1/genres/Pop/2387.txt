Now you wouldn't be the first no you wouldn't be the last We were out on something but we were going too fast You think you're made of stone but girl you're made of glass But you wouldn't be the first no you wouldn't be the last You wouldn't be the first you wouldn't be the last To give it all up to give it all up and move on past You wouldn't be the first you wouldn't be the last To give it all up to give it all up and move on past Now it started out the same but we made it our own game And you said that I lack soul but I never had to know And it was all just a game but we played it for the best times and the worst times but we wouldn't be the first and we wouldn't be the last You wouldn't be the first you wouldn't be the last To give it all up to give it all up and move on past You wouldn't be the first you wouldn't be the last To give it all up to give it all up and move on past
