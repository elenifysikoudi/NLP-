The most beautiful sound I ever heard All the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word Maria I just met a girl named Maria And suddenly that name Will never be the same To me Maria I just kissed a girl named Maria And suddenly I found How wonderful a sound Can be Maria Say it loud and there's music playing Say it soft and it's almost like praying Maria I'll never stop saying Maria Maria Maria Maria Say it loud and there's music playing Say it soft and it's almost like praying Maria I'll never stop saying Maria The most beautiful sound I ever heard Maria
