Time and time You've thought through it all How we loved and loved And how we fought each other Pushing one another to be somebody else And time and time I wrestled my thoughts Uncertain if the end was right or wrong And whether we should be together Or with somebody else That last memory She had water in her eyes She cried stay with me And asked how can this be love if you're leaving me But darling love's to blame And I can't see you right now 'Cause I just can't fake it Come be near you right now 'Cause I know you're no longer mine I can't see you It makes me ache That we had to break That even though I knew we had it so well We're strangers in different places though we live a mile apart My best friend's gone My world has been torn We'll never share a name Never be one But I will always remember the years we spent in love I still think of you I pray that you are safe I'm still missing you But it has to be this way cause I'm not right for you And that's why love's to blame And I can't see you right now 'Cause I just can't fake it Come be near you right now 'Cause I know you're no longer mine And I can't see you right now 'Cause I just can't take it Come be near you right now 'Cause I know you're no longer mine And I can't see you No I can't see you I just can't see you right now Maybe time will heal our hearts Maybe after time you'll understand I said goodbye but I love you And I can't see you right now 'Cause I just can't fake it Come be near you right now 'Cause I know you're no longer mine And I can't see you right now 'Cause my heart just can't take it Come be near you right now 'Cause I know you're no longer mine And I can't see you No I can't see you I just can't see you right now And I can't see you No I can't see you I just can't see you right now And love's to blame
