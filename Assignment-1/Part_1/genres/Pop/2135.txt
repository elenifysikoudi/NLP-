Lock of time hidden in my breath Of things real and things I've dreamt Holding hearts in balance it is like Maybe we were once intertwined Raising souls up to the moon as we Rise again Maybe then we will meet Only tides are racing through your mind Make a wish and then goodbye Charlatans in the ruse tonight Where heat and light touch the sky And the sun is rising slow there's more to write Lock of time written in my heart Why were we once torn apart Only tides are racing through your mind and each Time we meet it's bittersweet
