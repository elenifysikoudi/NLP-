I have second thoughts I just cannot explain Intermissions that keep stepping in the rain What if I was wrong when I abused vulnerable hearts What if I'm wrong to act like little lies don't hurt Second thoughts I just cannot regress Intuitions that keep keeping me awake What if I was wrong to take for granted what comes free What if I'm wrong to think there's nothing wrong with me All trouble makers will shake the ground And all double dealers will share the crown Too We're in a maze Feeling the same Sorry about this We're in the crowd Fooling around Sorry about this We're going home Opposite ways Facing the void We're in a maze Feeling the same Sorry about this I have second thoughts about what I confess Strange reactions that just don't match with the rest What if I turned all the offers down and cleaned the slate What if I finally accepted my mistakes Second thoughts about what I've just said Did I mean that or was I backing out again What if I decided to be brutally sincere If I had balls enough to face persistent fears All trouble makers will shake the ground And all double dealers will share the crown Too We're in the maze Feeling the same Sorry about this We're in the crowd Fooling around Sorry about this We're going home Opposite ways Facing the void We're in the a maze Feeling the same Sorry about this Oh We're in the maze Feeling the same Sorry about this Ah ah We're in the crowd Fooling around Sorry about this We're going home Opposite Ways Facing the void We're in the crowd Fooling around Sorry about this Sorry about this Sorry about this Sorry about this Sorry about this Sorry about this Sorry about this Sorry about this Sorry about this Sorry about this Sorry about this
