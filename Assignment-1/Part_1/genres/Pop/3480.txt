I have been trying hard to Keep the static low Drown out the trouble You know is gonna come Every day away our distance oh it grows Further and further so close to letting go Reach out a hand to me It's not over Keep all our memories Bring them closer And I wonder how you sleep at night You know that it's not just alright Your static is so far from me I have been trying hard to get you all alone Seems like the good days Are never gonna come Everything you say I hear that awful tone You're just so tired Those words are not your own Don't let them catch you Those fears that you have They creep all around you You're never prepared And I wonder how you sleep at night You know that it's not just alright Your static is so far from me And I wonder how you sleep at night You know that it's not just alright Your static is so far from me
