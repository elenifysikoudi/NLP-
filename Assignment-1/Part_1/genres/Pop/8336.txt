I'm counting the days to pass it's like walking on glass being mile after mile away from the one who make your day We turn against each other have no eyes for another and you make my world come alive you're everything I have And through all those days I just wanted to say beautiful I love you I swear to you it's true Hours since I last spoke to you you know there's nothing else I'd rather do and as the cold sets in I hear my phone ring Tell me everything tell me all you want something new or the same as last month afterwards I don't care what you said cause your voice is still like music in my head And through all those days I just wanted to say beautiful I love you I swear to you it's true Maybe I'm stronger now yeah I'm alright but there's still one thing that I fright it's losing my love losing my heart I don't ever want to be apart from you And through all those days I just wanted to say beautiful I love you I swear to you it's true
