In my room there's a box In that box a locket of us together I take it out press it to my heart think about throwing it in the river We're fighting g fire with tears One of us blows on the embers And then it feels like Plane trails in an empty sky Well you mark me the same way Hold devil hold Hold out your heart you never holla back but you can try to hold the ghost There's a shadow in my room as the day breaks Cant seem to fade away Still my lips do t form the words that one of us will have to say If this love runs pocket deep that's a bet that I'll have to take And then it feels like Plane trails in an empty sky Well you mark me the same way Hold devil hold Hold out your heart you never holla back but you can try to hold the ghost
