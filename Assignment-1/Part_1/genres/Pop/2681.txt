This is my white shadow a shadow of myself this is the last shadow there's no one left to blame You are my black widow a widow in the rain you are my eternal widow and keeping me insane This is my bright shadow a shadow of my face this is the single shadow there's nothing left to drain you are my dark widow a widow in the net you are my final widow and I had myself to blame My heart is blackened I am dying in your arms let this not be the last dance The floor collapses as we dance we are falling apart this is the world on fire this is the end of it all
