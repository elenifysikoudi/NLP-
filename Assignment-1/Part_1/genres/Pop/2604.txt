I found and you lost me Across the sea and ragin foam And I saw you and you saw me Through the smoke of a crowded room And God we were laughin' Right down to the sea And God we were laughin' Laughin you and me And I lost you and you found me Across the mountains and the clear blue skies And I saw you and you saw me In one glance of a stranger's eyes And God we were laughin' Right down to the sea Yes God we were laughin' Laughin you and me So put it down put it down and watch the leaves And they're fallin all around So put it down put it down Let the seeds touch the ground And God we were laughin' Right down to the sea And God we were laughin' Laughin you and me So I found you and you found me And I saw you and you saw me But I lost you and you lost me But God we were laughin'
