This is another time This is another life This is another fact you're brought to recognize the empty feeling rise boredom super size you can't break free you start to recognize in dark corners hide careless free rides hang in holes in walls to anesthetize The overwhelming drive Destroy to feel alive Genuflect to hate just to get a rise The'll cap you cold when you get caught but now you are on a roll and you're hot This is outlawed but that don't mean much This is outlawed but you got the get away touch you gotta pick a side your mind is always fried you're in no condition to decide it's just a power game always been the same the'll chop off your legs then the'll call you lame
