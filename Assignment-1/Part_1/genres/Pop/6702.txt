One summer night We fell in love One summer night I held you tight You and I Under the moon of love moon of love One summer night I kissed your lips One summer night I held you close You and I Under the moon of love You kissed me oh so tenderly And I knew this was love And as I held you oh so close I knew no one could ever take your place Oh one summer night We fell in love One summer night I held you tight You and I Under the moon of love moon of love Baby I love you so much When I hold you in my arms I feel eternal love I don't ever want to lose your love I want our love to last forever You kissed me oh so tenderly And I knew this was love And as I held you oh so close I knew no one could ever take your place Oh one summer night We fell in love One summer night I kissed your lips You and I Under the moon of love Moon of love
