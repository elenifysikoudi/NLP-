How could I know when I first met you I was falling in love never wanting to Cause out of the blue you went my way So lost for words don't know what to say It's a craving Feels like in misbehaving Feels like I'm going crazy Only you can save me I'm falling but I can't stop can't stop A little bit of you is never enough Feels like I'm falling falling Feels like a new day's dawning Try as I might I just can't hide When you came you unlocked all I had inside Like a piece of puzzle that slots in fine You came in my life and you made it right Just a feeling feeling It's not just my heart you're stealing You know all there is to know Cause you've seen inside my soul I'm falling but I can't stop can't stop A little bit of you is never enough Feels like I'm falling falling Feels like a new day's dawning You're on my mind all the time morning noon and night Without you without love I just can't survive no It's a craving Feels like in misbehaving Feels like I'm going crazy Only you can save me I'm falling but I can't stop can't stop A little bit of you is never enough Feels like I'm falling falling Feels like a new day's dawning
