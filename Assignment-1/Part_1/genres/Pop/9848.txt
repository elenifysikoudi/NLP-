I built a friend with three pieces of plastic and a pen I made him on the table in the den I gave him my old cellphone for a head For a head And we spent holidays in my house And we left presents in the stocking And we bought bolts and things and strings and a new watch That's what he got And we had so much fun together We knew we'd be friends forever And we had so much fun together we had so much fun Then I left for college in September And we wept cause we can't be together So I kept pictures to remember my old friend My old friend Then I met this girl at graduation And forget my oldest creation And I guess I'll see him next vacation Send my best I send my best And we had so much fun together We knew we'd be friends forever And we had so much fun together we had so much fun I came home to find him on the table with a note Scribbled out in pencil and he wrote That he just wasn't stable all alone All alone Next to him an empty glass of water that he spilled All over the body that I built It fizzled and it popped and then it killed And then it killed And we had so much fun together We knew we'd be friends forever And we had so much fun together we had so much fun I built a friend
