Ladies and gentlemen lights are going out let's sleep outside and watch the city sleep Listen and remember wait another day we are explorers far away from home Stay for just a moment watch the natives dance be civilized and kiss the pretty bride Brothers and sisters the pain is gone for now let's burn our books and find a little peace Sooner or later we walk another day we are colliders everywhere we go Stay for just a car crash know your heart is weak be primitive and wave your love good bye Ladies and gentlemen lights are going out let's sleep outside and watch the city sleep Preachers and sinners we are all the same let's save ourselves and drink from deeper wells Hatred and compassion wail against the walls we are invaders trying to escape Fight for just a lifetime count the moments lost be so alive and cry as time goes by Ladies and gentlemen lights are going out let's step outside and watch the city sleep Greater than the sun We are greater than the sun
