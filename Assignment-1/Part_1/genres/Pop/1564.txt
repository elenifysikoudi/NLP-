Who main the captain of the ship I think I feel a little seasick Storm and couples at a thrift Heavy weather on the voyage Broken wessless on the open sea I take it now before you hit the shore Call it love or call it immunity I can wait no more There's a man over board A man over board There's a man over board Mayday mayday A man over board There's a man over board A man over board Mayday mayday We better loosin up the ties Loose it low before we capside With so much water on the right It's like a ocean of emotion I decide that I ain't fallin in And wont let him get the best of you From here or now I think it's time to sink or swim Rip up to something new There's a man over board A man over board There's a man over board Mayday mayday A man over board There's a man over board A man over board Mayday mayday Yeah Man over board Man over board Man over board Mayday mayday Man over board Man over board Man over board Mayday mayday mayday mayday
