Wake up my soul and tired eyes It's time to go and realize Today is all we have Only pack the things you need Leave your fears and bring your dreams Today is all we have Hold me closer still Girl you know I will So let's run To chase the night away Come on love It's time for our escape No lookin back to yesterdays Let's run I see the line on the horizon Is that the place our hope's residing Yeah I will help you believe What if we lose our direction And find ourselves second guessing Yeah I will help you believe Hold me closer still Girl you know I will So let's run To chase the night away Come on love It's time for our escape No lookin back to yesterdays Let's run Don't stop now We'll make it out If we run So let's run To chase the night away Come on love It's time for our escape No lookin back to yesterdays Let's run
