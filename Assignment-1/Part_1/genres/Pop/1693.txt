Going home for Christmas Can't wait to be on my way To see once more the folks I've been missing This long and many a day Can't wait to get that old feeling Being back where I belong I saved my fare and I'll soon be there It's Christmas and I'm going home Going home for Christmas And the welcome that's waiting there I'll say goodbye to the lights of Broadway Farewell to old Times Square My home is plain and simple It's the place I was born And Bleeker Street just can't compete It's Christmas and I'm going home I saved my fare and I'll soon be there It's Christmas and I'm going home Going home for Christmas The way that it used to be See the candle burning there in the window Fairy lights on the tree Hear the laughter of the children See the wonder in their eyes Bring on the snow and the mistletoe It's Christmas and I'm going home Bring on the snow and the mistletoe It's Christmas and I'm going home I'm going home
