If hope is what you're after I can take it and turn it into rain Your tears become laughter I will catch them and turn them back again Yeah I will catch them and twist them back again When you're upside down then you see it all That you spend all your time pushing on a pull door You made a plan You think you're in control Yeah you're flying But you're way too high to fall And hey man Check around the corner Because it's coming Here's your wakeup call Don't hear Me coming I'm your wakeup call When you're upside down then you see it all Everything's the wrong way around but clearer than before When you're upside down then you see it all That you spend all your time pushing on a pull door I will shake you I will make your shattered dreams unwind Because it's only when it comes to pieces Only then this time increases You will find the piece that you've been dying for You'll realize that all this time You've been pushing on a pull door You've been pushing on a pull door Upside down then you see it all Everything's the wrong way around but clearer than before Oh you know when you're upside down then you see it all That you spend all your time pushing on a pull door When you're upside down then you see it all Everything's the wrong way around but clearer than before When you're upside down then you see it all That you spend all your time pushing on a pull door Hey pushing on a pull door You've been pushing on a pull door
