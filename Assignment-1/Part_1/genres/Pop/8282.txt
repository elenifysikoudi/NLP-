I feel lucky cause I've got my home I feel lucky cause I'm never alone I feel lucky when I sing a song But I've never been so lucky in love Have you ever put some salt in your coffee Have you ever brushed your teeth with soap Have you ever sang a song in a taxi Without thinking at all just what they might say Have you ever felt yourself <> As Madonna dancing <> Have you ever thought you're gonna go crazy Don't you worry love is knocking at your door I feel lucky cause I've got my home I feel lucky cause I'm never alone I feel lucky when I sing a song But I've never been so lucky in love Have you ever said goodnight in the morning Have you ever fed your dog with chips Have you ever spent the night in the moonlight Looking for back at time that never comes to me Have you ever cried watching a movie Have you ever told a lie to your friend Are you waiting by the phone for that call Don't you worry love is gonna save the day I feel lucky cause I'm falling in love I'd never thought it could happen to me I feel lucky cause I'm falling in love And now I know that this time it's for real Yeah
