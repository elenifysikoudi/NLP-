Girl I know the hall looks dark And the storm it seems so scary Your face lit up on beats of lightning You start you start running And your eyes are like screaming And since there is no end and no beginning You will run You will run You will run Girl I know the woods look dark And the trees they seem so deadly The girls around you are so frightened And you start you start to panic And the courage starts to vanish And the world it really is on fire And it burns And it burns And it burns And it burns Vivian your life is told through 19 thousand pages In a world too unreal to behold Your innocence has faded Faded all your blues to gray Your skin has bruised through moving days Glue is peeling back away Curling cracking painted Girl you've been rolled up in colorful carpets Your blood is rushing look around you You're froze you're frozen quiet And your eyes they are widened Room unfurnished no light for nightfall Just rugs for rolling you up you know you can't get up When you do you swear you will run You will run You will run You will run No one will ever save you If no one can ever find you No one will ever save you If no one can ever find you Lost girls Lost girls Lost girls Lost girls
