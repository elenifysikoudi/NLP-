I know how it ended up here on this frozen nameless shore I remember nothing of the journey and there's no one else around I cut down across the towering dunes to see the seagulls glide above So graceful when they are silent like lonely white ghosts in the air I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die As I look and dream myself away a sound is loud enough to hear Like disembodied friendly voices carried on by southbound winds I wake up to the sound of silence it's wasn't faint and far away Like the finest spray of water they still speak of things I know I turn to fix my eyes on the horizon and I face the freezing gale I observe the majestic wide waves as they rise and break and fall I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die While they rise into the wild wind that picks them up before they strike Steals away their urgent faces lifts the spirits to the skies And the language soft and broken but still I understand it well We talk about the ones we care for and of all the things we lost I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die
