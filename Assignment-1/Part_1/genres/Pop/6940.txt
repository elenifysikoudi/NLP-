In me there are a million different pieces to my heart And at any moment they could fall apart And leave me lost My mind hasn't been made up in years There's million voices are ringing in my ears And I feel lost I'm dying inside From the way I live my life I'm stuck inside in a web made up of my doubt I fear I'll never find my way out I'm dying inside Some days I run around in circles just to find I am searching for what's right before my eyes But I'm still lost Today I'm staring the truth right in the face But I can't find the strength to let it stay In my heart I'm dying inside From the way I live my life I'm stuck inside in a web made up of my doubt I fear I'll never find my way out I'm dying inside
