Ooo girl I'd walk a hundred miles To see your pretty face each time you smile There is no distance from me as long as I can believe I'll see you tonight Simply no distance from me Girl you gotta believe I need you tonight I'll never forget the first time I set My eyes on you I thought I would die You were my lovely day took my breath away Now I'm walking with my head to the sky You are the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in this world You came in my life just in time You are the most beautiful girl I've just got to tell the world She's all mine I just can't find the words to say This kind of feeling don't come every day It feels like heaven to me love has given me wings Girl you light up my life You feel like heaven to me every day's like a dream Having you by my side I'll never forget the first time I set My eyes on you I thought I would cry It was my lucky day when you came my way And I'm still walking with my head to the sky Chorus Oh girl The sun and the moon the stars in the skies They don't shine as bright as the light in your eyes And it brightens my day when I realize In just a few hours I'll be holding you tight Chorus Out Written by Brion James Mikelyn Roderick and Gary St Clair
