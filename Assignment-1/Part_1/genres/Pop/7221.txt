Am I anyone to ease the way You want inner calm I deviate I'm not what you want to be I'm not the same Can't live in doubt with or without finding out And here it ends I've given all that I really want And if I reap what I sow Maybe I'm not the only one While I'm wide awake this to you I dedicate Learn to read between the words I hope you get what you deserve Am I the one to compromise Can't live in doubt with or without finding out No sacrifice I've given all that I really want And if I reap what I sow Maybe I'm not the only one Who needs room enough to grow Maybe I'm not the only one While I'm wide awake this to you I dedicate Learn to read between the words Hope you get what you deserve I've given all that I really want And if I reap what I sow Maybe I'm not the only one Who needs room enough to grow I've given all that I really want If I reap what I sow Maybe I'm not the only one While I'm wide awake this to you I dedicate Learn to read between the words Hope you get what you deserve
