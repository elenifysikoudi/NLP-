Soaked yourself beneath my skin I don't know why I don't when But you're burning my eyes again I stumble through the doorway I fall to my floor way Time stands still As I lay here suffering A sacrifice for all your sins You bleed me now you bled me then But I'm hanging around again I scramble to the driveway Then blackout on the highway Time stands still And I lay here wondering Does it ever get any better Does it get much worse with soap I followed you down to the letter But still I got no hope Playing a game I'll never win There's no way to save my skin Because you're burning me on purpose Epidermis Is scarring from the charring Full of cuts and lacerations That keep me suffering Does it ever get any better Does it get much worse with rope I followed you down to the letter Still I've got no hope P Allgood J Bowden BMI Grey Vireo Ent 2011
