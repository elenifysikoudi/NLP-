Held in this gaze Where's the sun tonight Help me escape All this it multiplies Ever give up on fate There's a truth a mile high Never give up again Witness you through my eyes Oh I know He is here And I lost in this blame I'm lost in this pain Show me the shape of your mother's arms Help me explain your father's eyes Never give up again There's a truth a mile high What's the worst of faith It ensures a goodbye Oh I know He is here And I laugh at this blame I laugh at this pain Oh I know He is here And I'm lost in this pain Eternity's tales Where do I belong can I belong with you Turn my head Underneath the summer moon Feel his breath Conjure up the truth I feel I'm so confused I feel Kiss this night Photographic memory I feel I'm lost again Underneath my heart holds this gravity I feel full of this uncertainty Take me away from this I know he is here I laugh at this blame Can I live with this pain Oh how do I know he is here I look at your face I belong oh I belong I know I belong to you
