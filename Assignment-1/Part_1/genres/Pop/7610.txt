We don't talk Like we used to do before Many things have changed We're both not the same no Empty nights You're never by my side I waited so long How can I carry on I misunderstood Don't know how I could You were giving signs I guess I didn't read them right Said you needed change Had to go away Guess I should have known That I'd be all alone Cause we don't talk like we used to baby Cause we don't talk like we used to baby No conversation no communication Can't remember the time When your time was mine Seems so long ago That we used to hold Time has come to pass You see I've woken at last I misunderstood Don't see how I could You were giving signs I guess I didn't read them right Said you needed change Had to go away Guess I should have known That I'd be all alone Should have seen That things weren't right We could never meet See eye to eye We're not talking anymore So there'll never be a chance For us to fight anymore Cause we don't talk like we used to baby Cause we don't talk like we used to baby Should have seen That things weren't right We should never meet See eye to eye We're not talking anymore So there'll never be a chance For us to fight anymore
