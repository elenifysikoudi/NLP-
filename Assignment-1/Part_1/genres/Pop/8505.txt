I feel like I've been locked in tight For a century of lonely nights Waiting for someone to release me Thinking of rain blowing kisses my way That don't mean I'm gonna hear what you say Baby baby Oh woah woah my mind is saying let's go Oh woah woah but my heart is saying no If you wanna be with me Baby there's a price to pay I'm a genie in a bottle You gotta ask me the right way If you wanna be with me I can make your wish come true You gotta make a big impression I've gotta like what you do I'm a genie in a bottle baby Gotta catch me the right way honey I'm a genie in a bottle baby Come come come in and let me out The music's fading and the light's down low Just one more dance and then we're good to go Waiting for someone who gets me Heart is racing at the speed of light Let's go and have a little fun tonight Baby baby Oh woah woah my mind is saying let's go Oh woah woah but my heart is saying no If you wanna be with me Baby there's a price to pay I'm a genie in a bottle You gotta ask me the right way If you wanna be with me I can make your wish come true Just come and set me free Baby and I'll be with you I'm a genie in a bottle baby Gotta catch me the right way honey I'm a genie in a bottle baby Come come come in and let me out I'm a genie in a bottle baby Gotta catch me the right way honey I'm a genie in a bottle baby Come come come in and let me out Oh woah woah My mind is saying let's go Oh woah woah But my heart is saying no If you wanna be with me Baby there's a price to pay I'm a genie in a bottle You gotta ask me the right way If you wanna be with me I can make your wish come true Just come and set me free Baby and I'll be with you I'm a genie in a bottle baby Gotta catch me the right way honey I'm a genie in a bottle baby Come come come in and let me out I'm a genie in a bottle baby Gotta catch me the right way honey I'm a genie in a bottle baby Come come come in and let me out I'm a genie in a bottle baby
