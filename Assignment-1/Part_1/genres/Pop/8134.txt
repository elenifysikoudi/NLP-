"Verse 1 I don't know where you are in your life 'Cause I can see your heart when I look into your eyes But with so many people filled with pain I can't take the chance I just have to say Chorus Mercy never leaves when others walk away Mercy's there for you so you don't ever have to be afraid When you're feeling hopeless abandoned and lost Mercy pleads your case before the cross Mercy never leaves Verse 2 Ohhh there is hope though you can't see it now And you will be so amazed at how this song turns out In your darkest hour just hold on You will make it through Take courage and be strong Chorus Mercy never leaves when others walk away Mercy's there for you so you don't ever have to be afraid When you're feeling hopeless abandoned and lost Mercy pleads your case before the cross Mercy never leaves Bridge ""You are worthy "" Mercy cries ""To be rescued to be brought inside"" Chorus Mercy never leaves when others walk away Mercy's there for you so you don't ever have to be afraid When you're feeling hopeless abandoned and lost Mercy pleads your case before the cross Mercy never leaves Outro ""You are worthy "" Mercy cries Mercy never leaves ""To be rescued Yeah to be brought inside"" "
