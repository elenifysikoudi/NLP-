Every time I fall for your eyes Like the raindrops fall from the sky Every time I hear your name In this loving game There is something in the way Your eyes talk to me Just as if they seem to say Stay here with me babe Just as if they seem to say Stay with me Every time I fall for your eyes Like the raindrops fall from the sky Every time I hear your name In this loving game All I need is to express it all My echo listens When I hear myself confess You are my weakness When I hear myself confess You are my weakness Every time I fall for your eyes Like the raindrops fall from the sky Every time I hear your name In this loving game I say I say I say Every time I fall for your eyes Like the raindrops fall from the sky Every time I hear your name In this loving game Every time I fall for your eyes Like the raindrops fall from the sky Every time I hear your name In this loving game Every time I fall for your eyes Like the raindrops fall from the sky Every time I hear your name
