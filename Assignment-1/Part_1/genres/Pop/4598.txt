So much joy that you bring You make my body wanna sing When you do that thing you do I'm right here where I wanna be The weekends here and we got time To slow it down and make it just right Long bubble baths will do us fine Scented candles and red wine Come on over Come tonight lay me down Turn me out I'm in the mood See you tonight after work Turn me out cause I'm in the mood Unplug the telephone So we can be left alone When you put your hands on me You don't know what you do to me So many things I wanna do Let me take it out on you Hope you feel what I'm feeling I've been wanting you all week Come tonight lay me down Turn me out I'm in the mood See you tonight after work Turn me out cause I'm in the mood Come tonight Come tonight Don't tease me don't tease me Come tonight Come please me come please me Come tonight I wanna kiss you all over Come tonight Can't wait to see you my baby my baby Come tonight lay me down Turn me out I'm in the mood See you tonight after work Turn me out cause I'm in the mood
