I know that everyone's running Just trying to get away you you can't get away Life can feel a lot like a rat race Like everyday is so mundane But I am saying Hey hey oh oh I'm not getting caught in the undertow I'll keep taking it easy and taking it slow I'm never gonna follow no Turn it up make it loud on your radio We are gonna dance everywhere we go Everybody knows That's how we roll Why don't you come on and join us Take your rose off the grindstone Take take your hands off the keyboard And put down the iPhone And let me hear you say Hey hey oh oh We ain't getting caught in the undertow We'll keep taking it easy and taking it slow We're never gonna follow no Turn it up make it loud on your radio We are gonna dance everywhere we go Everybody knows That's how we roll That's how we roll Don't fold under the pressure A smile can make it better Whoa ya know ya know yeah Don't fold under the pressure A smile can make it better And if everything goes wrong Keep singing this song Turn it up make it loud You you can't get away Don't don't try to get away Turn it up make it loud You you can't get away Don't don't try to get away oh no Turn it up make it loud on your radio We are gonna dance everywhere we go Everybody knows That's how we roll That's how we roll
