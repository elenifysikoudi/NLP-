You ask me where I go tonight I go back to today last year when we knew how to make each other happier now there's hope with everything It's hard enough to feel the world as it is and hold on anything Without these quiet times you've brought round here I'm gonna have to run away I'm sure that I belong some other place I've seen another side of all I've seen it keeps me wondering where my family is Its hard enough to see the world as it is and hold on anything Without these quiet times coming round here Now I miss you Now I want you But I can't have you Even when you're here I suppose I have to take you with me broken mind I'd rather leave you here To forget everything you've seen and known erase every idea And you walk up in the street and hold my hand and smile Well I won't be taken in cause I know how it turns out And it takes me back to these quiet times coming round here Now I miss you Now I want you You're not coming back And I need you But I can't have you Even when you're here Now I miss you Now I want you You're not coming back And I need you But I can't have you Even when you're here
