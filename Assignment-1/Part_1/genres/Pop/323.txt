Verse 1 When you fall I'll carry you When you're lost I'll guide you home Want the world to see You're the one for me When you're hurt I feel the pain When you're gone All I see is rain Risk it all Just so I can say Hook 1 You're my beginning and end My lover my best friend Only three words I can think of That my broken heart can mend I love you I love you I love you Yeah I love you Verse 2 When the sun fades away And the light is only shades of gray I'll be next to you Be there to pull you through If you cry I'll dry your tears If you're scared I'll calm your fears Baby you're the answer To my prayers Hook 2 You're my beginning and end My lover my best friend Only three words I can think of That my broken heart can mend I love you I love you I love you Yeah I love you Bridge You're my anchor my seed Fill my soul help me breathe You're the wind to my wings Shooting star destiny And I know Need you to know Outro I love you I love you There's nowhere else I'd rather be Then holding you close right next to me You know we've come so far I love you I love you
