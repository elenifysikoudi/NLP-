Is it real can I see you Or is it just elusive dreaming Far and away are you Am I here in your breath Remnants of where you are I am Lost and how I wait for you holding on After all this time I still carry my heart blind oh I am killing time with liars its all this time It's in your voice all we are is nowhere that I am Lonely and I still wait for you holding on After all this time I still carry my heart blind oh I am killing time with liars it's only time All this time recreating my mind eyes open wide to all this crime After all this time I still carry my heart blind After all this time I am still blind Still Killing time with liars All this time recreating my mind all this time
