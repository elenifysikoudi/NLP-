Like a seed becomes a mighty oak And a mother's smile brings a child hope Or ideas born in a daydream You are so much more than you see So maybe give in the inside track But you've got ahead holdin nothing back Like the last one chosen by the worst team You're so much more than you see With your will to win give it all you've got You've already won win or not The race isn't far It's who you are When they said you can't it's impossible You became unstoppable Even if you gave a world's speed You're so much more than you see You reach far beyond a life long goal What you did was so unbelievable You've inspired us who dared to dream You are so much more than you see With your will to win give it all you've got You've already won win or not The race isn't far It's who you are
