A paper crown and a heart made of glass A tattered gown and her kingdom of ash She walks alone she can never look back The story of a queen whose castle has fallen to the sea She'll make it out but she's never the same She's looking down at the scars that remain But you hold your ground though your kingdoms in flames Cause it's the story of a queen who's castle has fallen to the sea Knowing there's no one who will be a king that will come and save his queen When all she needs when all she wants when all she finds When all she is and ever was is compromised Cause there's no one to love her When you build your walls too high And there's no one to love you when you build your walls too high She's looking out from the war that's inside She's screaming out cause no one survived But when you're all alone you wait and you hide Cause it's the story of a queen whose castle has fallen to the sea Knowing there's no one who will be a king who will come and save his queen When all she needs when all she wants when all she finds When all she is and ever was is compromised Cause there's no one to love her When you built your walls too high And there's no one to love you when you build your walls too high There's no one who is strong enough to save your love There's no fairytale There's no fairytale When all she needs when all she wants when all she finds When all she is and ever was is compromised Cause there's no one to love her When you build your walls too high And there's no one to love you when you trap yourself inside
