Every time you go away I know it wont be for long though it seems And all the time we spend apart that ticking tock clock seems to last for weeks Well I guess it is quite long to expect you to climb up here each week Yes I guess it aint so long four hours on a bus for yous a treat And it wont be long All day long I sit here x 3 Thinkin bout you Yes I know theres a million miles and aeroplanes they keep us apart But when I sit alone at night on my bus darling well your in my heart And it wont be long So complicated times have passed but am sorry babe I feel the same for you Yes I know I broke it off but am sorry babe ya just didnt stay true And it wont be long All day long I sit here thinkin bout you
