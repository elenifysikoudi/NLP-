You tempt me with a single touch You're turnin me on you've powered me up My memory is burnin up So press stop before you're any closer System overload you move it like a pro Your body language is comin to me in stereo It seems that you were made for me I'm programmed to love and make you mine Your binary love my binary love Love there's nothin left to do but take your time Your binary love my binary love So let imagination start to take control Your binary love my binary love So systematically we're made to be alone Your binary love my binary love So tell me tell me Have you ever felt a connection this strong Dynamic symmetry The way we move is like electric poetry in motion Sensory overload define original Seduct a frequency comin to me in stereo It seems that you were made for me I'm programmed to love and make you mine Your binary love my binary love Love there's nothin left to do but take your time Your binary love my binary love So let imagination start to take control Your binary love my binary love So systematically we're made to be alone Your binary love my binary love Binary love binary love Floatin through time and space The world feels so far away We're connected through our binary love Floatin through time and space The world feels so far away We're connected through our binary love I'm programmed to love and make you mine Your binary love my binary love Love there's nothin left to do but take your time Your binary love my binary love So let imagination start to take control Your binary love my binary love So systematically we're made to be alone Your binary love my binary love
