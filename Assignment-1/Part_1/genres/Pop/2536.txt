"I opened the door to your head Tried going quietly but the door slammed instead I yelled ""Why'd I even come here "" But still I stayed for a while looked in every draw that I could find Saw you calendar on the floor you're not very organized are you I said to myself I said to myself you should go you should leave Good side pulling on my sleeve But I stood there I stood there with a note from my head Opposite of what my heart said Oh I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I went through all your dirty laundry even those smelly socks I wonder where where those even came from Saw everything you had lying around From your deck of cards to the way you feel about me Just lying on the ground I said to myself I said to myself you should go you should leave Good side pulling on my sleeve But I stood there I stood there with a note from my head Opposite of what my heart said Oh I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I said to myself I said to myself you should go you should leave Good side pulling on my sleeve But I stood there I stood there with a note from my head Opposite of what my heart said Oh I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know Oh I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know"
