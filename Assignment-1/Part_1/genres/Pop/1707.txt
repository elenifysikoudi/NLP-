1 Out on the Mira on warm afternoons Old men go fishin with black line and spoons And if they catch nothin they never complain I wish I was with them again 2 As boys in their boats call to girls on the shore Teasin the ones that they dearly adore And into the evning the courting begins I wish I was with them again Chorus Can you imagine a piece of the universe More fit for princes and kings Ill trade you ten of your cities for Marion Bridge And the pleasure it brings 3 Out on the Mira on soft summer nights Bon fires blaze to the childrens delight They dance round the flames singin songs with their friends I wish I was with them again 4 And over the ashes the stories are told Of witches and werewolves and Oak Island gold Stars on the river face sparkle and spin I wish I was with them again Chorus 5 Out on the Mira the people are kind They treat you to homebrew and help you unwind And if you come broken theyll see that you mend I wish I was with them again 6 Now Ill conclude with a wish you go well Sweet be your dreamsand your happiness swell Ill leave you here for my journey begins Im going to be with them again Im going to be with them again
