What child is this laid to rest While Mary's man is sleeping Whom angles greet with anthems sweet While shepherds watch their king Why lies he in such lowly place While cows and sheep are feeding Good christian fear for sinners here A silent word is pleading This is Christ the King Whom shepherds guard and angles sing Hast hast to bring him praise The baby son of Mary So bring him incense gold and myrrh Come peasant King to owe him The king of kings salvation bring That loving hearts in throne
