You can sleep forever but still you will be tired You can stay as cold as stone but still you won't find peace With you I feel I'm the meek leading the blind With you I feel I'm just spending wasted time I've been waiting I'm still waiting I've been waiting I've been waiting I've been waiting I'm still waiting But with you it's always one step too far With you One step too far You can whine to the bone but still you won't be full You can look down on the world but still you won't find love You won't find love Only with mellow are you thin enough to slide through If the sun or the moon should give way to doubt They would immediately go out One swallow don't make a summer But tomorrow has to start somewhere Only with mellow are you thin enough to slide through Only with mellow are you thin enough to slide through Don't let nothing ride you Only with mellow are you thin enough to slide through Don't let nothing ride you One swallow don't make a summer I've been waiting I'm still waiting But with you it's always one step too far One step too far I've been waiting I've been waiting I'm still waiting I've been waiting I've been waiting I've been waiting But with you it's always one step too far One step too far
