You would not believe your eyes I know that it sounds unwise She's so smart and yeah she's just a friend But she lit up the Yule Ball My heart pushed against a wall Just frozen staring here in the Great Hall I'd like to make myself believe That she would look back at me It's hard to say I'd rather leave than see her here with him But everything is never as it seems with Hermione I've gotten a thousand hugs just tonight from Victor Krum The Durmstrang boy who gave me a chance But something just isn't right It's not how I viewed tonight I wasted time waiting for Ron's invite I'd like to make myself believe That stupid boy would ask me It's hard to say cause he's stubborn and a pig and fights with me But everything is never as it seems with Ron Weasley Oh Ronald Weasley you're the worst Please take me away from here Maybe next time you should ask me first Please take me away from here Victor's dumb but he treats me right Please take me away from here Now excuse me while I enjoy my night Cause I'd cast a thousand charms She makes me feel so unarmed I wonder if Harry's noticed yet Oh he can be such a slime But even if she's not mine I won't give up these things just take time I'd like to make myself believe That someday you'll fall for me It's not like I'm gonna tell you to your face or anything But til it happens I'll still have my dreams of you and me I'd like to make myself believe That someday you'll fall for me It's not like I'm gonna tell you to your face or anything But til it happens I'll still have my dreams of you and me I'd like to make myself believe That someday you'll fall for me It's not like I'm gonna tell you to your face or anything Cause I am too afraid you'd disagree
