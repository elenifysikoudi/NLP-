I see you waiting but I'm not ready To take that first step towards home So please be patient God knows I'm trying But these good intentions are not enough You've pulled back your veil laid it all on the line But I've turned my back and covered my eyes So please please please please cripple me So I cannot keep running away Away from you I'm walking on a wire but you're holding it steady And you're taking me higher but I'm getting heavy Just give me some time I am almost a man Without you by my side I don't know who I am So please please please please cripple me So I cannot keep running away Away from you
