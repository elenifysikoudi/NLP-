I wanna set the world on fire Until it's burning bright for you It's everything that I desire Can I be the one you use I I am small but You you are big enough I I am weak but You you are strong enough To take my dreams Come and give them wings Lord with you There's nothing I cannot do Nothing I cannot do I wanna feed the hungry children And reach across the fathers farthest land And tell the broken there is healing And mercy in the Father's hands I I am small but You you are big enough I I am weak but You you are strong enough To take my dreams Come and give them wings Lord with you There's nothing I cannot do Nothing I cannot do Take my dreams Come and give them wings And Lord with you There's nothing I cannot do My hands my feet My everything My life my love Lord use me I wanna set the world on fire Wanna set the world on fire Take my dreams Come and give them wings Lord with you There's nothing I cannot do Oh no Take my dreams Come and give them wings Cause Lord with you There's nothing I can't do Nothing I can't do I'm gonna set the world on fire Set the world on fire
