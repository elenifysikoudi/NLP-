Ah Ah Ah Ah There is fortune in my name Currency in letters If this life is just a game I'll try to play it better We all started just the same The hopeful and the hopeless On the streets we made our name Our confidence our harness I know the marks They don't show on the outside But each of us carries a tale And one of these days We won't talk anymore Silence begins when we fail And I Think I might break Ah Ah Ah Ah Now we separate again But who to lay the blame on These years of laying claim To values I could count on I know the marks They don't show on the outside But each of us carries a tale One of these days We won't talk anymore Silence begins when we fail And I Think I might break Ah And I Ah Think I might break Ah And I Ah Think I might break
