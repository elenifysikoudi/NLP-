"Don't make me say it You don't want to hear it I held it in the hope my heart could change You say you're not But you seem so certain I'm really sorry but I just don't feel the same You can pin all the blame on me Because I want to feel love Real love Deep down love Don't try to shatter all my hopes of true love Don't try to tell me there's no such thing as ""the one"" I understand I understand clearly It doesn't happen like it happens in the movies I'm aware I don't care I'm a dreamer And I want to feel love Real love Deep down love Deep down love While I was gone all my friends got married Who's fooling who I don't want to die lonely So love's got time But I'm not gonna lie to you But I want to feel love Real love Deep down love I want to feel love Real love True love I want to feel love True love True love True love True foolish love Real love True love"
