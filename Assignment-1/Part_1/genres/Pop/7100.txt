I've been stuck for what seems like years Finally free And what do I see I see eyes and they're looking at me There's so much to be They say you grow when you're asleep in bed I won't give in I must up the fight I'm gonna keep my eyes wide All day and night My dreams are bigger than me How will I get there Who will I have to be I'm so eager and I'm so scared There's so much to see They say you grow when you're asleep in bed I won't give in I must up the fight I'm gonna keep my eyes wide All day and night Everyday I feel a little more like me I get to pay the bills and sometimes I get shoes for free I'm fine Yeah I'm fine A little stressed out at times it's true But I found my own ways of getting through I'm fine Mom I'm fine I've been there and I've done that I've got the photos and I've got the scars to prove it I'm so tired and I'm so glad For what I have They say you grow when you're asleep in bed I'd like to know I won't put up the fight I'm gonna rest my head Until the lights go out Lights out sleep tight Lights out sleep tight Lights out lights out Sleep tight tonight
