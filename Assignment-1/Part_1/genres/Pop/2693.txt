In transit you pass among the strangers of the world Paying tribute to the thief who stole away your shadow You look into the bedrock and listen to the bells Calling liquid lust call for solid white I see the stalker in your face the secrets on your skin I keep the wisdom that you need the password that you want I feel the stalker in your mind the fire in your veins No hope to be released I see the stalker in your face the secrets on your skin I keep the wisdom that you need the password that you want I feel the stalker in your mind the fire in your veins No hope to be released I'm a multitude of travels to the other side Through the broken wall I saw your fellow man To the west of the horizon there is a bitter wind And if you try to sense the smell of your face For you found the keyhole but you lost your backbone No courage left to join the march of endless time You saw the sleep of habit on those who walk in trance To their catatonic aimless lives I see the stalker in your face the secrets on your skin I keep the wisdom that you need the password that you want I feel the stalker in your mind the fire in your veins No hope to be released I see the stalker in your face the secrets on your skin I keep the wisdom that you need the password that you want I feel the stalker in your mind the fire in your veins No hope to be released So let them start the engine grinding mountain dust And reproduce your ego too much is not enough You dig holes through the earth to meet the king of worms To steal away his wisdom and learn to decompose You chant like fifty Indians to charm the prince of eagles To learn the art of seeing and the tongue of the winds So don't you try to fool me for I watch your every move We are kindred spirits like two voices in the wild I see the stalker in your face the secrets on your skin I keep the wisdom that you need the password that you want I feel the stalker in your mind the fire in your veins No hope to be released I see the stalker in your face the secrets on your skin I keep the wisdom that you need the password that you want I feel the stalker in your mind the fire in your veins No hope to be released
