drones behold the life that was given be aware of the choices within your grasp oppose the temptress who leaves you dry redeem what was lost unleash your will hail the ones who take nothing for granted praise the moments of the giving day worship the sensation that passes by forever conquer yourself for the kingdom of fury I want to stand in the eye of the storm I want to get struck by lightning I want our house to be set on fire for us to walk without shelter I seek no rest I seek no shelter where weak dwell in the shadow of decay I want to walk forever with the storm until I become the prey anyway
