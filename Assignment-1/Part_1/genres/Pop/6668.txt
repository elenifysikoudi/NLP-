It's been 2 weeks and I heard today You told your girl you got rid of me Girl you know it's true I got rid of you So start speakin truth cause I could see Right through you Baby we need to set the record straight Keep it real girl why you tryin hate I thought that we could end still being friends But I'm seein now that you're still trippin' B Section It didn't have to be you versus me But you started this now I'll finish it But now I'll let them know why I let you go Hook You're so selfish you don't care about no one else 'Cause you lie and cheat You're money hungry Always tryin to creep but you can't play me You're so hopeless girl you don't even see That you're paper thin you don't have no friends And the only one who cared was me Why you doin all things you do Girl I thought that you said that we were through But you're paging me and still calling me It aint hard to see that you still wanting me You're tellin everyone it's over now But you keep makin your way back some how No matter what you do girl I'm through with you Just let me be stop chasing me B section It didn't have to be you versus me But you started this now I'll finish it But now I'll let them know why I let you go Hook Breakdown
