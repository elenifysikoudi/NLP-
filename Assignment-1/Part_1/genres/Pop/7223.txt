Satellites fall away Every time I close my eyes The sum of my own denial Echoes for a thousand miles Gravity pulls Shadows on the runway Sent to battle over me Layers in reality Ill find an open road Sleep out on the back seat I need to see the sky The color of the blue sea I could be gone a while We have come a long way Further than our reason lies All that still survives Is stranger than we realize Ill find an open road Sleep out on the back seat I need to see the sky The color of the blue sea I could be gone a while Gravity pulls Falling from a stolen high Im out of the will that I put in Nothing more to hide behind Ill find an open road Sleep out on the back seat I need to see the sky The color of the blue sea Ill find an open road Sleep out on the back seat I need to see the sky The color of the blue sea I could be gone a while I need to see the sky
