Why do some people like pain And how come some things never change Why do I always seem to find the same girl Why do I do it How do I do it I guess my karma just ain't right Cause when it comes to love I try But I can't seem to get it right lately baby CHORUS I started writing you a love song But baby now the love's gone So I just wanna close my eyes And watch it all disappear disappear so this is not a love song this is not a love song Cause baby now the love is gone I just wanna close my eyes And watch it all disappear disappear Somebody hold me down Somebody hold me now Somebody hold me down Somebody hold me now now now I used to be the type of guy To find the girl and keep the girl But these days I find the girl And can't wait to leave her I walk around in another town Like I must be her first Just don't make sense no And it's a shame you just might bid one girl on all my dreams And right now I'd do anything to get you back home my dear And sorry isn't good enough for you it seems I got her CHORUS I started writing you a love song But baby now the love's gone So I just wanna close my eyes And watch it all disappear disappear so this is not a love song this is not a love song Cause baby now the love is gone I just wanna close my eyes And watch it all disappear disappear Somebody hold me down Somebody hold me now Somebody hold me down Somebody hold me now now now
