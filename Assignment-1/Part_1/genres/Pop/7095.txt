Its scary to be fragile in this turning world This world it turns me upside down On board there's a plank set aside Nailed down and ready to be walked These splinters in my hands won't go I've held on tonight What will happen tonight I've tried before Its scary to be fragile in this turning world This world it turns me upside down Upstairs there's a cupboard and a key There's a coat inside that fits me I put it on and wonder where the buttons have gone Where have they gone I couldn't say Its scary to be fragile in this turning world This world it turns me upside down I won't believe it's all been done before This world is getting scary It's scary to be fragile What have we done
