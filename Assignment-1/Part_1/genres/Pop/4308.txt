This is a band We are two mans And you must understand That we mean fun So everyone Get up and clap your hands Buckle down and feel the seismic shift Of the party inside my pants Take a glance at your desperate soul Lose control and add on my trance OH We're here to show you motherfuckers the reason We get paid up front in bricks of gold So get familiar with the way that this feels Open up your mouth and swallow us whole Bow tie is straight Ascot looks great Ready to lay some pipe On all you cats Vermins and rats Under my purple lights I bet you never felt you might hand clap Shake the shoes right off your feet We decorate and excavate your house Put your family back out on the street OH We're here to show you motherfuckers the reason We get paid up front in bricks of gold So get familiar with the way that this feels Open up your mouth and swallow us whole We're here to welcome Pleasure's all mine But we must warn you Shit could fuck with your mind We're here to welcome Pleasure's all mine But we must warn you Shit could fuck with your mind We're here to show you motherfuckers the reason We get paid up front in bricks of gold So get familiar with the way that this feels Open up your mouth and swallow us whole
