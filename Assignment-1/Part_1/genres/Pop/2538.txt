"Here I am gullible for now Here I am A solid box for now This is only for now But I'm not so sure Seems the bugs hit the windshield More than ever before spinning doubt I know that you want to You know that you want to Here I am insecure for now This is only for now But I'm not so sure Seems the bugs hit the windshield More than ever before spinning doubt I know that you want to You know that you want to The smell of the matches The weight of this floor The way that your hair says ""You don't need me anymore "" I know that you want to You know that you want to This is only for now But I'm not so sure Seems the bugs hit the windshield More than ever before spinning doubt "
