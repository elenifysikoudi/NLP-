Behold the beauty that surrounds us See the wonders we take for granted Roam the world in all her glory Sail the seas and climb the mountains Discover things you never knew Be happy that you're alive So many reasons to remain So many people to embrace So many stories to be told So many errors to correct Turn your gaze towards the moon Even further if you dare Turn your face towards the sun And be grateful that it's there Behold the beauty we have made us All the wonders that we created See the cities of the ancients In the deserts and the jungles
