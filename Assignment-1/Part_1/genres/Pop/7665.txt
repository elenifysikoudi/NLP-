Now I yearn to Follow you and Everything I do All those years in Isolation Helped me water you Lead me to a Place I'm free from All the wrongs I do In return I'll live my life Forever loving you Closer I'm here to be closer Closer To you to you to you to you Closer I'm ready now Closer Closer To you to you to you to you In my mind Eternal darkness Seemed like it was true Also wretched wretched wretched wr wretched Seeing you I was weary I was sleepy But you held me through Carried me along the sand Your footsteps gold and couth Closer I'm here to be closer Closer To you to you to you to you Closer I'm ready now Closer Closer To you to you to you to you All those years in Isolation
