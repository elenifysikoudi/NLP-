We met at a ski lodge and we fell in love Right by a fireplace We shared our first embrace And then inside my heart I felt a fire start It's gonna snow outside the weather will be cold But I'm gonna be warm this winter uh huh Each time your lips touch mine They taste like sparkling wine I feel so warm a glow Just cause I love you so It's cozy in your arms I'm yours to have and to hold And I'm gonna be warm this winter Ice skating on a frozen lake Sleigh riding down a mountainside Roasting popcorn dancing till the dawn That was how I knew love was born born born born It's just like make believe Each night is New Year's Eve Each day is Christmas Day You make me feel this way It's gonna snow outside the weather will be cold But I'm gonna be warm this winter It's gonna snow outside the weather will be cold But I'm gonna be warm this winter Whoa whoa whoa honey make me warm this winter Mmmm baby make me warm this winter Whoa whoa whoa I'll be warm this winter
