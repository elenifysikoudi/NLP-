Saddle up baby a storm is on The horizon The war in the distance is marching toward Our back door And you you're all I have Take my hand baby I'll lead the way Don't be afraid We'll walk through the valleys and through the fields With our love as a shield Yeah we will be all right At least at least in our minds Love you will ever forgive me If I slip and let you fall I'm not sure if I could catch you 'Cause I'm still learning how to love Honestly baby I hate to say That I am afraid I have been following close behind But I could be blind Maybe we're each on our own My apologies baby I think I made A mistake on the way The war is closing in on us What have we done We used to be so strong Now things things are all wrong Love will you ever forgive me Now that I've slipped and let you fall I'm sorry I couldn't catch you 'Cause I was learning how to love And I'm still learning how to love Saddle up baby a storm is on The horizon
