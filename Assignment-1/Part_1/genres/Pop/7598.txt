I just want to hold you I just want to show you how I feel I can't keep it all to myself Got to let my feelings free Let's live for the moment On time that is stolen You are are just what I need Now we're back in each other's arms I want you right here next to me Who could love you more The way that I do Who could love you more The way that I do There's something between us Said those who had seen us from the start We knew that we had it all But we just let it fall apart Let's live for the moment On time that is stolen You are just what I need Now we're back in each other's arms I want you right here next to me I'm glad that I got you back I got you to myself Now I'm nolonger sad I really don't need nobody else
