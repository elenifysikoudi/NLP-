I shy away in my mind In hopes in that I could share this place with you You'll be the first one to find The shadows that make the girl you undo 'Cause the man that you are is to find By the way you act in the light Break or seize me If the flame gets blown out in the shine I will know that you can not be mine Never leave me When I trust you we can do it with the lights on When I trust you we'll make love until the morning Let me tell you all my secrets and I'll whisper til the day's done When I trust you we can do it with the lights on When I trust you we'll make love until the morning Let me tell you all my secrets and I'll whisper til the day's done Break or seize me Let the things that I tell you survive In the way that you handle your size Never leave me When I trust you we can do it with the lights on When I trust you we'll make love until the morning Let me tell you all my secrets and I'll whisper til the day's done When I trust you we can do it with the lights on When I trust you we'll make love until the morning Let me tell you all my secrets and I'll whisper til the day's done When I trust you we can do it with the lights on When I trust you we'll make love until the morning Let me tell you all my secrets and I'll whisper til the day's done When I trust you we can do it with the lights on When I trust you we'll make love until the morning Let me tell you all my secrets and I'll whisper til the day's done
