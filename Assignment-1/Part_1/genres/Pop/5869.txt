Where Do I Go Follow the river Where Do I Go Follow the gulls Where is the something Where is the someone That tells me if I live and die Where Do I Go Follow the children Where Do I Go Follow their smiles Is there an answer in their sweet faces That tells me if I live and die Follow the wind song follow the thunder Follow the neon in young lovers eyes Down to the gutter up to the glitter Into the city where the truth lies Where Do I Go Follow my heartbeat Where Do I Go Follow my hand Where were they lead me And will I ever discover why I live and die Good Morning Starshine the earth says hello Why don't you join us we sing Our early morning singing song Gliddy gloop gloopy Nibby nobby nooby La la la lo lo Where Do I Go Sabba sibby sabba Nooby abba dabba Le le Le lo Le le Le lo dooby ooby walla dooby abba dabba Song song song sing Sing sing sing song Song song song sing Sing sing sing song Good Morning Starshine Where do I go Follow my heartbeat Where do I go Follow my hand Is there an answer in their sweet faces That tell you why you live and die Where Do I Go Follow my heartbeat Where Do I Go Follow my hand Where were they lead me And will I ever discover why I live and die I live and die I live and die
