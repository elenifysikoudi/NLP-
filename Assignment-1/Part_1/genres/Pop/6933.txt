I see the trees waving their raised hands Praising the one who planted them there I wish I could see from high up in the air But I'm stuck here on the ground With my wounds holding me down Hold on spirit hold on soul Hold on little heart let's fly solo Take it easy or take it slow Doesn't even matter which way we go Hold on little heart let's fly solo So I sewed on a pair of homemade wings I stood on the shoulders of my father to see Next thing I knew I lost feeling in my feet Surrounded by the clouds I left my wounds on the ground Hold on spirit hold on soul Hold on little heart let's fly solo Take it easy or ta ke it slow Doesn't even matter which way we go Hold on little heart let's fly solo Ooo Hold on spirit hold on soul Hold on little heart let's fly solo Take it easy or take it slow Doesn't even matter which way we go Hold on little heart let's fly solo
