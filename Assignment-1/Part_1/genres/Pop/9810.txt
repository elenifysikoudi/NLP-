Hey does it ever make you wonder what's on my mind Hey I was only running back to your side I never cried I just watched my life go by And now you're leaving me behind Why after this long is there nothing I'll keep Oh I can shout but you'll pretend you're asleep I live a lie Believing that you're mine Or was it just a waste of time Chorus Hey there's not a cloud in the sky It's as blue as your goodbye And I thought that it would rain on a day like today Hey there's not a cloud in sight It's as blue as your goodbye And I thought that it would rain on the day you went away Hey does it ever make you wonder what's on my mind I was only running back to your side I never cried I just watched my life go by And how you're leaving me behind
