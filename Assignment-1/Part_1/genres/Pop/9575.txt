"Oh these guys that are playing your heart Tryin to trick a girl like it's an art Here today but he's gone tomorrow Tryin to get with this I don't need the sorrow Why can't they see what this girl Wants why are all the guys all Big smile sweet talk While checking out my body parts My boy is makin his move slow My boy knows how to make a girl glow My boy he doesn't come late no Always comes when the time is right though I don't need no fast love I need a love that last so My boy won't you come and rescue me Won't you come and rescue me Talking bout your car bout your cash bout your game Everybody's sounding the same it's a shame They are promoting when I need devotion You need to slow it down show me some emotion Why can't they see what this girl Wants why are all the guys all ""my love is your love"" The first night you meet them Ohh I'm looking for the real deal Yeah I'm looking for a love that feels I want my boy My boy won't you come and rescue me Ohh won't you come and rescue me Yeah oooh yeah "
