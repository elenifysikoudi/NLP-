Don't mind the snow that's falling The carol singer's calling I'm just happy to be spending our first Christmas together And I'll be more than jolly With the mistletoe and holly Tonight as we are counting down to Christmas Together you and me With those jingle bells ringing As I'm holding you near I'll be making a toast May tonight be the most Unforgettable night of the year The sound of jingle bells and laughter Will remind us ever after Of how we spent that magically first Christmas Together you and me Just you and me With those jingle bells ringing As I'm holding you near I'll be making a toast May tonight be the most Unforgettable night of the year the year Cuddle up and cozy The future's looking rosy And I can us spending every Christmas Together just you and me Just you and me Just you and me Just you and me
