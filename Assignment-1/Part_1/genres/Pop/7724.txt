This is where it begins This is where all the worry ends This is where I say I don't need to have control This is where I admit I don't know how to handle it Life in all of this chaos You're my only hope And all that I have to offer Is the white flag of surrender So take me to the middle of Your heart Lead me to wherever Your love starts To a new day dawning To the place You are And if You want to take me over the edge I'll let you cause Your love is where I'll land Wanna be right where You are In the middle of Your heart This is what I believe That if I give you my everything I will become who I was really born to be I'll stand up and say it Yeah Your love is something I can put my faith in So take me to the middle of Your heart Lead me to wherever Your love starts To a new day dawning To the place You are And if You wanna take me over the edge I'll let you cause Your love is where I'll land Wanna be right where You are In the middle of Your heart What I carry What I carry But now I can let it go Yeah I carry it Lord I carry it But now I can let it go Yeah I can let it go So take me to the middle of Your heart Lead me to wherever Your love starts To a new day dawning To the place You are And if You wanna take me over the edge I'll let you cause Your love is where I'll land Wanna be right where You are In the middle of Your heart The middle of Your heart
