Where do I begin To tell the story Of how grateful love can be The sweet love story That is older than the sea That sings the truth about the love she brings to me Where do I start With the first hello She gave the meaning To this empty world of mine That never did Another love another time She came into my life And made a living fine She fills my heart She fills my heart With very special things With angel songs With wild imaginings She fills my soul With so much love That anywhere I go I'm never lonely With her along who could be lonely I reach for her hand Its always there How long does it last Can love be measured by the hours in a day I have no answers no But this much I can say I know I'll need her till this love song burn away And she'll be there How long does it last Can love be measured by the hours in a day I have no answers no But this much I can say I know I'll need her till this love song burn away And she'll be there
