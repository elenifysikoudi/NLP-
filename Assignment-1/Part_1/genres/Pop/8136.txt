Try and put your arms around a hundred year old tree Or climb up on a horse and let it run full speed Or take a look down at the world from thirty thousand feet on your next flight Go watch a flock of birds against the morning sun Close your eyes and listen to the river run Or catch a firefly in your hand or a raindrop on your tongue That's right There is a God There is a God There is a God How much proof do you need Plant a seed and see what comes out of the ground Or find the heartbeat on your baby's ultrasound Put a few years here and don't it sound like a song And stop and think about what you don't understand Things like life and love and how the world began And the doctors say they can't explain this but the cancer's gone There is a God There is a God There is a God How much proof do you need The science says it's only circumstance Like this whole world's just an accident But if you want to shoot that theory down Then look around just look around There is a God How much proof do you need There is a God There is a God There is a God How much proof do you need
