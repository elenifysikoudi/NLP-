Come here Sweet girl Let me hold you I'll kiss the tiredness away There's so many good things I owe you And you're gonna have them all some day Got no money No place to go But we can dance the radio 'Cause you can't go wrong with a fovorite song And Michael Jachson in stereo Get the bottle I need some wine I want your body Love Ever close to mine Gotta private show dancing to the radio One day I'm gonna take you to London We'll stay at a fancy hotel And baby You'll knock em dead in the disco But tonight this ll do just as well Got no money No place to go Got no money No place to go Get the bottle I need some wine I want your body Love Ever close to mine Gotta private show dancing to the radio Got no money No place to go
