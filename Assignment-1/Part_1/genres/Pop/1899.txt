I sink like a stone with all your weight up on me weight up on me Your eyes in the ground will leave a stain upon me stain upon me Cause I'm nothing like you ooh Cause I'm nothing like you I can never tell you the trut You know there's a price to pay for living through me You know there's a price to pay Show me What I used to be Show me What I used to be I'm gon need a diamond stone to release me to release me Cause I'm nothing like you ooh I could never tell you the truth You know there's a price to pay For living through me
