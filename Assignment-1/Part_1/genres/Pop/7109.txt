We hide behind the hills We walk through tunnelled fields And no one sees us holding hands Love Don't point Don't scare it Oh Love Don't point don't scare it We sneak into the trees We hide beneath the leaves And nobody will find us here Oh we dance across the lake We laugh into the wind And nobody will find us out Love Don't point Don't scare it Oh Love Don't point Don't scare it Please We creep along the lanes We sneak through seven gates We pass a flock of birds Who didn't flinch a feather This cliff will keep us safe We hide beneath it's walls Alone again it's It's time to kiss Love Don't point Don't scare it Oh Love Don't point Don't scare it Love oh love Oooh love don't point Don't scare it
