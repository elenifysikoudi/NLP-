Here's a song for lovers Who don't care if they don't sleep If dragonflies with heavy hearts Cut the air like darts Here's a song for lovers Who won't ever have to weep Clear sighted eyes and uncried tears All dried out in the sun Ooh You were far too young dear To get so close to the clouds No one told you to stay awake For pleasures of that kind You were far too small to set foot Outside of your house Now you saw how dragonflies Sting their hearts with darts Ooh Here's a song for lovers Who don't care if they bleed
