I lay here under the stars in awe of who you are You've never been so real I'll never understand it fully Lost here in your beauty No words could say how I feel It's like I'm seeing for the first time Like you opened my eyes to show me Everything I've missed before And I want more I used to think we were worlds apart But look here you are Let's stay here for awhile Where heaven touches earth my heart begins to turn I've never felt so alive It's like I'm seeing for the first time Like you opened my eyes to show me Everything I've missed before And I want more How many years did you plan this moment here To show me how you love me How many years did you plan this moment here To show me how you love me It's like I'm seeing for the first time Like you opened my eyes to show me Everything I've missed before It's like I'm seeing for the first time Like you opened my eyes to show me Everything I've missed before And I want more of you I want more I want more More more more more
