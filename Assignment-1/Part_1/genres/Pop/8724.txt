First act I wake to find the hope To see you simply staring back at me But still there's only emptiness calling To break the dream I once believed Now I'm scared that this reality Is much too heavy for me I'm too weak to be strong I can't be the only one Holding on till the day you find me So meet me at the end of the world I'm waiting Meet me at the end of the world Please save me This could be the place where we start The rest of our lives rest of our life Meet me at the end the end of the world Meet me at the end of the world You found the place I hide within Like you see right through my skin And my heart to see I'm hopelessly wishing You can forgive all my mistakes Take them back and just erase all the Wrong and let our future get brighter I'm too weak to be strong I can't be the only one Holding on till the day you find me So meet me at the end of the world I'm waiting Meet me at the end of the world Please save me This could be the place where we start The rest of our lives rest of our life Meet me at the end the end of the world Meet me at the end of the world Till these shadows disappear I still wait to find you here Still I'm haunted from the moment I feared oh Never forget what it's like To surrender in your eyes Holding on till the day you find me So meet me at the end of the world I'm waiting Meet me at the end of the world Please save me This could be the place where we start The rest of our lives rest of our life So meet me at the end of the world I'm waiting Meet me at the end of the world Please save me This could be the place where we start The rest of our lives rest of our life Meet me at the end the end of the world Meet me at the end of the world
