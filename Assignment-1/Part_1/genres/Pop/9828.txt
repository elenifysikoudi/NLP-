I close my eyes till I see neon jungles And suddenly everything's green around me I close my eyes till there's no one around Every face that I know simply gone long gone when Out of sight no love can last when Out of reach no pun can hold when Out of joy no stories can be told Into the lights on restrainders I throw myself Blinded and wild they will take me places Out in the blue wanting planets in bloom All they're dawning and reasonable speed embrace and Out of sight no love can last when Out of reach no pun can hold when Out of joy that's when we're all alone Nature knows that pain Nature seeks the gain Nature will remain I hear the sound of the sirens approach Are they going to save me arrest or save me I hear the sound of disonant reproaches I hear That I know I will not deserve when Out of sight no love can last when Out of reach no pun can hold when Out of joy that's when we break a goal Nature knows that pain Nature seeks the gain Nature will remain Nature knows that pain Nature seeks the gain Nature will remain
