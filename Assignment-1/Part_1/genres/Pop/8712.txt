Waking up on the battlefield Fears lie like gunfire in our eyes Can't change the way we feel It hurts us every time Throwing hearts that will never heal There's nothing left in here And we fight while we cry It's surrender do or die And we don't know why This is a sad song for all the long gone With melodies that kill me This is a sad song So sing with me tonight Just sing with me Whoa oh oh wha uh oh Whoa oh wha uh oh This bed is a battlefield All alone with your memories in my heart Lie awake and my fate is sealed You haunt me in the dark Love you are the death of me One touch you can make me bleed And we fight while we cry It's surrender do or die And we don't know why This is a sad song for all the long gone With melodies that kill me This is a sad song So sing with me tonight Just sing with me Whoa oh oh wha uh oh Whoa oh wha uh oh Whoa oh uh uh uh uh oh uh uh uh Whoa oh uh uh uh uh oh uh uh uh Whoa oh uh uh uh uh oh uh uh uh Whoa oh whoa This is a sad song wounded and war torn With words that make your heart ache This is a sad song This is our goodbye A wah oh This is a sad song for all the long gone With melodies that kill me This is a sad song So sing with me tonight Just sing with me Whoa oh oh wha uh oh Whoa oh wha uh oh Whoa oh oh wha uh oh Whoa oh wha uh oh A battlefield it's a battlefield whoa oh o oh It's a battlefield ooh march with me ooh march with me Ooh march with me Ooh march march with me Ooh march with me yeah Ooh yeah Ooh march with me This is a sad song Will you march with me This is a sad song Will you march with me This is a sad song Who will march with me This is a sad song This is a sad song oh oh oh This is a sad song oh oh
