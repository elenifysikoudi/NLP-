Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh Hit rewind Click delete Stand face to face with the younger me All of the mistakes All of the heartbreaks Here's what I'd do differently I'd Love like I'm not scared Give when it's not fair Live life for another Take time for a brother Fight for the weak ones Speak out for freedom Find faith in the battle Stand tall but above it all Fix my eyes on You On You I learned the lines and talked the talk Everybody knows that everybody knows that 'Cause the road less traveled was hard to walk Everybody knows that everybody knows It takes a soldier Who knows his orders To walk the walk I'm supposed to walk Love like I'm not scared Give when it's not fair Live life for another Take time for a brother Fight for the weak ones Speak out for freedom Find faith in the battle Stand tall but above it all Fix my eyes on You On You The things of Earth are dimming In the light of Your glory and grace I'll set my sights upon Heaven I'm fixing my eyes on you Love like I'm not scared Give when it's not fair Live life for another Take time for a brother Fight for the weak ones Speak out for freedom Find faith in the battle Stand tall but above it all Fix my eyes on You On You Fix my eyes On you
