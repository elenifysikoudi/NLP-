They come from the farms and the factories too And they all soon forget who they are The cares of today are soon washed away As they sit at a stool by the bar The girl with green eyes in the Rolling Stones shirt Doesn't look like she works on the land The man at the end he's a very good friend Of a man who sells cars second hand Down at the Red Rose Cafe in the Harbour There by the port just outside Amsterdam Everyone shares in the songs and the laughter Everyone there is so happy to be there The salesmen relax with a few pints of beer As they try not to speak about trade The poet won't write any verses tonight He may sing a sweet serenade So pull up a chair and forget about life It's a good thing to do now and then And if you like it here I have an idea Tomorrow let's all meet again
