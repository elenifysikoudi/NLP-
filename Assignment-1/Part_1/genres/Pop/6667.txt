When i close my eyes at night I pray That God would send your love my way Pray that he sends a love so sweet Someone to take good care of me Someone to take my heart And make it their own And love only me alone That's when I found you And i know that it's true God gave me you cause CHORUS I I prayed for you Everytime I close my eyes I belive deep in my hear that God would come through Cause I prayed for you When you're in my arms I feel so blessed Cause I know your love is heaven sent With every song that my heart sings I owe to the joy that your love brings Now I'm gonna take your heart And make it my own and I'll never leave you alone Thank God I found you And for all that you do All this came true cause CHORUS Bridge Somehow I made it threw those times When I wasn't sure aat all You came and you changed my life And I know that you were sent from above Cause I CHORUS
