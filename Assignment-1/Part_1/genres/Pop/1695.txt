Hello again hello Just called to say hello I couldn't sleep at all tonight I know it's late But I couldn't wait Hello my friend hello Just called to let you know I think about you every night When I'm here alone And you're there at home Hello Maybe it's been crazy Maybe I'm to blame But I put my heart above my head We've been through it all and you love me just the same When you're not there I just need to hear Hello my friend hello It's good to need you so It's good to love you like I do And to feel this way When I hear you say Hello
