I just dropped in to see you all I'll only stay awhile I want to hear how you're getting on I want to see you smile I'm happy to be back again And greet you big and small For there's no place else on this earth quite like The homes of Donegal I long to see your smiling children Standing by the door The kettle boiling on the hearth As I walked up the floor And then to see a waiting for me Travellers one and all For your heart's alive in your mountain size In the homes of Donegal I like to lie lie along with you While away at night With fairy lore and tales of yore Beside the surf fire bright And then to see laid out for me A shake down by the wall For there's rest for weary wanderers In the homes of Donegal Donegal queen of all Donegal queen of all
