My life I'd give for you anema e core I only live for you anema e core I have but one desire and it's to love you With all my heart with all my soul my whole life through From stars I'll make your crown and kneel before you I pray you'll take my hand for I adore you Open up the doors leading to heaven A heaven mine and yours anema e core My life I'd give for you anema e core I only live for you anema e core I have but one desire and it's to love you With all my heart with all my soul my whole life through In ev'ry dream I stand breathless before you I pray you'll take my hand for I adore you Open up the doors leading to heaven A heaven mine and yours anema e core
