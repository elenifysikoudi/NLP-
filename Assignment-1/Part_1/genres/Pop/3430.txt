Broken into pieces My disease is That I care About the world and the people living in the world Show me pictures of starving children I get angry then change the station Still more picture of starving children I get angry then I get hungry When I worked for UNICEF It seemed to be the way for Jesus to get my autograph I sing their tears away Choking over treacle They cannot hear from over there We made a movie then shot the sequel Documentaries cos we care Cue the pictures of starving children Change the angle change location Still more victims like dying children Nominate me for an Elie Then we posed for photographs Everyone was brave A smile a hug and gentle laugh Will feed their pain away Words on broken phonographs Reeking with decay Close our eyes to circumstance Hope it goes away I'm Broken Broken We're Broken Broken
