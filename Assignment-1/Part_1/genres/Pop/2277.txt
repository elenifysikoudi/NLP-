You say you love me You say you love me but you don't you say you need me but you know I just can't cope with all the dreaming and the hope you just want to use me up and leave me here and let me go You say you love me I want to know what you mean I need to know how you feel when you say you love me I know you want me in your life it's just the way you want me that doesn't feel so right I know you're trying to ease my mind Oh but it's not so reassuring if you don't know for certain You're everything I wanted You're everything and more but you keep lookin over my shoulder at that open door this world is full of silence and I am just a thought but you'll never find me if you keep on looking for the only one You say you love me I want to know what you mean I need to know how you feel when you say you love me You say you love me You say you love me you know I just can't deal I want to know what you mean you know the way I feel I need to know how you feel tell me are you for real When you say you love me You say you love me you say I want to know what you mean Just tell me how does it feel When you say you love me
