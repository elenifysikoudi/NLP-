So here we are now my friends Gathered together again To celebrate bittersweet life So here's to our struggles and strife Let's make the most of these hours Till time defeats all with its powers And lets make the most till the dawn Keep on going until we are gone break acoustical interlude One day there will come a time When we'll all face our crimes All the tears that we've caused To hide our fears and our flaws Getting so low and so high Caught between gutter and sky And we go through all of this Just for a small taste of bliss chorus break Keep on going keep on going Until I'm gone until we're gone So come on come on so come on come on Come on come on come on come on Keep on going keep on going Until I'm gone until we're gone So come on come on so come on come on Come on come on come on come on Each of us breathing inside Each just along for the ride And each of us cursed to roam We can never go home Nobody else understood But why just think they would And do you think its how we planned We're doing the best the best that we can chorus break Keep on going keep on going Until I'm gone until we're gone So come on come on so come on come on Come on come on come on come on Keep on going keep on going Until I'm gone until we're gone So come on come on so come on come on Come on come on come on come on
