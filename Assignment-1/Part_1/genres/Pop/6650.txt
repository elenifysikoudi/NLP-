What can I say When I can't find the words to possibly explain What I'm feeling inside I tried to believe My whole kept faith everyday that passed me by And then you came in my life And now I am living proof Of what the gift of pure love can do When I needed an angel Here was you who made the sacrifice Just in the nick of time When I needed an angel I didn't have to look to the sky Cos you made me realize That you were right here all the time right here all the time Right here all the time Sometimes I cry When I think about everything you've done for me And I still can't believe That I can live my life Every breath I take I take for you and me That's a promise I'll keep And each night I think of you And how your gift of love pulled me through When I needed an angel Here was you who made the sacrifice Just in the nick of time When I needed an angel I didn't have to look to the sky Cos you made me realize You were right here all the time right here all the time Right here all the time Baby one day everyone will say That I wanna be somebody's angel And I will tell the world tell the world about this miracle Every moment I'm awake I'll give the love you gave Oh angel When I needed an angel Here was you who made the sacrifice Just in the nick of time When I needed an angel I didn't have to look to the sky Cos you made me realize That you were right here all the time You were right here all the time
