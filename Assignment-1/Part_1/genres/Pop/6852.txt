I wasn't ready for this You left me here on my own So this is where I stand I wasn't ready for this The bright days all suddenly turned dark Walking here all by myself Wondering what went wrong Wait what I said or didn't say How did I get in this mess In being so alone All I know is that you disappeared I wasn't ready for this You left me here on my own I wasn't ready for this To house a cold eclipsing heart Ooh a cold heart Walking here all by myself Wondering what went wrong That I couldn't know of Didn't see All those dreams now fulfilled Why did they stop to glow All I know is that you disappeared Everywhere I turn and go I feel the ghost of you Memories haunt my ever troubled mind How I wish for this to end Find peace and start a new All I know is that you disappeared
