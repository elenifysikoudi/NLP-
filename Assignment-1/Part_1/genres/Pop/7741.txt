What do you do when you don't get better Strong arms get too get too weak to hold her Oh God give me just enough strength to make it through Sleepless this madness is walking me out to the ledge And stands there beside me shivering out on the edge And oh God all I all I ask is a little relief just a moment of peace I don't want to live without you I'm not ready to live without you So let's dance a little laugh a little hope a little more 'Cause I don't want to leave without you without you This thorn in my side though it cuts and stings me Has opened these eyes I've never seen so clearly And oh God I thank You cause You bring me to my knees Back on my knees I heard a voice from the other side singing Hold fast love lasts As winter turns into summertime singing Hold fast love lasts I heard a voice from the other side singing Hold fast love lasts As winter turns into summertime singing Hold fast So let's dance a little laugh a little and hope a little more Yes let's dance a little laugh a little and hope a little more 'Cause I don't want to leave without you No I don't wanna live without you without you
