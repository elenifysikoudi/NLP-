"I have climbed highest mountains I have run through the fields Only to be with you Only to be with you I have run I have crawled I have scaled these city walls These city walls Only to be with you But I still haven't found what I'm looking for But I still haven't found what I'm looking for I have kissed honey lips Felt the healing finger tips Burn like a fire This burning desire I have spoke with tongue of angels I have held the hand of devils Warm in the night I was cold as a stone But I still haven't found what I'm looking for But I still haven't found what I'm looking for But I still haven't found what I'm looking for But I still haven't found what I'm looking for But I still haven't found what I'm looking for But I still haven't found what I""m looking for I have climbed highest mountains I have run through the fields Only to be with you Only to be with you But I still haven't found what I""m looking for But I still haven't found what I'm looking for But I still haven't found what I""m looking for"
