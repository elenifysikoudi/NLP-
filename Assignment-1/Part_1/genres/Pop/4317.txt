Somebody call my baby Somebody call her up real quick I think I need my fix Always around to please me Always around to take control I never feel alone Yeah Chorus But you feel so clean Well she craves affection So I use protection And I know she loves me She loves everybody Baby oh no Oh yeah Darling oh no Oh yeah Baby oh Verse 2 You're just a little girl now You're just a girl who misses her dad And all the toys that she had Thought I could make you older Thought I could keep you out of harm But now you're caught in my arms Chorus But you feel so clean Well she craves affection So I use protection And I know she loves me She loves everybody Baby oh no Oh yeah Darling oh no Oh yeah Baby oh Verse 3 Now that we've made it this far Now that we've made a mess in the car You ought to give it a rest Chorus But you feel so clean Well she craves affection So I use protection And I know she loves me She loves everybody But you feel so clean Well she craves affection So I use protection And I know she loves me She loves everybody
