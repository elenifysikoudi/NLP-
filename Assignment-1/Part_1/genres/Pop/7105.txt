Just one tear are shed for this Just one tear And not one more Say you'll never do the same again Say hello Say hello to the high life The one you dream about The one you think about Second night Second night to the one you live On your way knowing That they'll be there in the morning Just one tear are shed for this Just one tear And not one more Say you'll never do the same again Just one tear are shed for this Just one tear And not one more Say you'll never do the same again You don't know You don't know how what a daydream I could be the girl who kisses everyone at the party Say hello Say hello to the new girl Who's she here for You should've seen her freeze in the doorway Just one tear are shed for this Just one tear And not one more Say you'll never do the same again Just one tear are shed for this Just one tear And not one more Say you'll never do the same again Do I feel sadness Do I feel shame I'd cover my face now but all of these turn to stone Except one thing I can't control Watch it slowly roll down my face Across my lips The lips you loved Well stupid me for thinking I was the only one you ever needed Just one tear are shed for this Just one tear And not one more Say you'll never do the same again Just one kiss Yeah right Just one kiss You said you'd never do the same Just one kiss I leave with you Just one kiss Before I go We'll never be the same again
