Whoa whoa I thought I needed space to take some time away I wanted back my life and my freedom You said you won't stand in my way You let me go but now I know That space just means I'm lonely with this void inside And time now moves so slowly since you said goodbye Girl I've tried to go on with my life But how can I live when we've died And I thought the grass on the other side would be greener than you and I But now I'm lost in black and white I know I can't save this but I need to say this Without you life just isn't life at all Life at all I heard you packed my things gave them all away Threw out our memories tried to forget me Wish I could fix your broken heart But I'm afraid it's too late 'Cause now I only see you when you're in my dreams And I don't wanna wake up cause it means you'll leave It's really hard being all alone When everything love is gone Such a pill to swallow that you won't be there tomorrow Guess it's true what they say I got back all I gave I know I'm far from perfect And yes I do deserve all of this pain I thought I stretched my legs ran so far away At first I really thought it was a good thing I figured we'd be better off But I was so so so so wrong so so wrong I know I can't save it but I need to say this Without you life just isn't life at all
