She touched the world with her smile And paved the way so many times The look in her always of love Sometimes at night I heard her in pain Though she'd never tell me No trace of a that's just how she was And she was the sunshine of my morning Her cloud of love floating by She looked up to the heavens one day And heard him say It's time to come home It's time to come home Her love was always a blanket of joy In world so cold I knew I'd never be be alone And through the heart she held me tight She said she believed in me Her gift was love and it kept me strong And she was the sunshine of my morning Her cloud of love floating by She looked up to the heavens one day And heard him say It's time to come home I have to tell this vision to you Perhaps you know perhaps it is true Love like this only comes once And she was the sunshine of my morning Her cloud of love floating by She looked up to the heavens one day And heard him say It's time And she was the sunshine of my morning Her cloud of love floating by She looked up to the heavens one day And heard him say It's time to come home
