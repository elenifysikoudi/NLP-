You look so loney just standing there Hurting from love You smile but cannot hide the pain of losing too much I know your heart's been hurt so many times And you don't want to fall in love again Let me dry each tear you cry I'll show you how to love again Just take my hand and we'll fly away Chase all our dreams Just close your eyes and let me take you To places you've never seen I know your heart's been hurt so many times And you don't want to fall in love again Let me dry each tear you cry I'll show you how to love again So when you're feeling strange afraid or insecure Let me be the one to take your hand And leave you safe and warm I know what you're thinking That you've heard it all before And if you don't believe I mean what I say Then baby walk out that door I know your heart's been hurt so many times And you don't want to fall in love again Let me dry each tear you cry I'll show you how to love again I know your heart's been hurt so many times And you don't want to fall in love again Let me dry each tear you cry I'll show you how to love again Hurt so many times And you don't want to fall in love again Let me dry each tear you cry I'll show you how to love again Let me dry each tear you cry How to love again Hurt too many times And you don't want to fall in love again Let me dry each tear you cry I'll show you how to love again
