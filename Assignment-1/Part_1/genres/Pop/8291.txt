I've got the real thing Here by my side Someone who loves me Treating me right Love makes the world go crazy And I think I'm crazy for you L need someone who'll save me And you know I'm talking to you Take me to your heart When it's cold and dark I just wanna feel the magic Hold me in your arms I've got the real thing Here by my side Someone who needs me Holding me tight Time takes your life and chances And we all got so much to give If real love is precious Now I know it's time to believe Every word you say Show me that you care I just want to say that You're the answer to my prayer
