Last night I cried and cried myself to sleep I ain't been to work one day this week oh no You probably think I'm kinda crazy But I'm just crazy about you baby And I know it's time to get over you I don't really wanna see nobody I just wanna stay right here Unplug the phone sit here and wait for you For you to come back to me Won't somebody tell me please When will I get through this pain Things the same won't be the same Until you come back to me What would my friends think if they saw me like this They think I'm always the one so in control But you got me chasing a dream that could never be And I know I gotta get over you I don't really wanna see nobody I just wanna stay right here Unplug the phone sit here and wait for you For you to come back to me Won't somebody tell me please When will I get through this pain Things the same won't be the same Until you come back to me Don't make me leave it behind what we had boy 'Cause darling you'll never find a love that's truer than mine Maybe one day you'll see that my love was true Please tell me why why did you leave I don't really wanna see nobody I just wanna stay right here Unplug the phone sit here and wait for you For you to come back to me Won't somebody tell me please When will I get through this pain Things the same won't be the same Until you come back to me
