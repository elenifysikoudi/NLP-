Baby you're a work of art A shooting star Lighting up the darkness So lucky that we found this yeah You know you've got me losing sleep I can't believe the beauty of this moment It's all I've ever wanted But I can't love you I can't love you today I can't love you tomorrow I can't love you anyway I can't love you anyhow I can't love you love you I can't love you today I can't love you tomorrow I can't love you anyway I can't love you anyhow I can't love you love you I love the way you touch my lips You live to kiss The freckles on my shoulder So I can pull you closer yeah Some people search all their lives for what we've got A fairy tale in motion With hearts deep as the ocean But I can't love you I can't love you today I can't love you tomorrow I can't love you anyway I can't love you anyhow I can't love you love you I can't love you today I can't love you tomorrow I can't love you anyway I can't love you anyhow I can't love you love you Wrote a chapter full of us Just to burn it up I can't love you love you Tied to bed with bright green eyes Just to come undone But I can't love you I can't love you today I can't love you tomorrow I can't love you anyway I can't love you anyhow I can't love you love you I can't love you today I can't love you tomorrow I can't love you anyway I can't love you anyhow I can't love you love you
