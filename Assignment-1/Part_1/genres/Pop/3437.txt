"The time is 8 09 I'm running to the line The one that takes me down Down to Chinatown There's shouting in the streets A pattering of feet Intrigue is everywhere Total chaos Chinese restaurant We're meeting here tonight We ll say goodbye For one more time Chinese restaurant Keep breaking up and mending Seems to be the pattern of your love A writing on the wall A symbol tells it all I should have known before She was moving on Mysterious almond eyes Incapable of lies I should have known before She was moving on It's just like a movie We kiss and she walks away Alone on the sidewalk I'm left like a fool today It's just like a movie My fortune cookie says ""Keep on moving on your way She'll be back here once again"" "
