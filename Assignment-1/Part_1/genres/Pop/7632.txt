We've come too far we can't turn back Have our good days have our bad When I'm feeling blue And you say that I'm hurting you We try so hard not to fight But sometimes we cross the line Then I want to leave But you won't let me We have our highs and lows Just like everybody else Doesn't mean that we walk away We work through our mistakes Chorus Sometimes I love you Sometimes I don't But I never ever never want to let you go The road's not easy But the feelings strong It's the little things that keep me holding on We're both guilty of mistakes Though you rarely take the blame Are you coming through Sometimes I hate you But it's not mistakes in life you make It's the good you do along the way The dues you pay We have our highs and lows Something everybody knows Doesn't mean that we run away We work through our mistakes Chorus Of all the crazy things in life that's been It's you and me We've come so far sometimes I can't believe but I wouldn't change a thing Chorus x 3
