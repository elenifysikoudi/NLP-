I know what you came for And I know when you'll leave You came for my heart And it's lost to me For I won't stop you I will open my door My heart is here waiting I don't need it no more I know why you're leaving And I'll just let it be I am left with nothing and now you're lost to me For I can't stop you I will open my door My heart is here waiting I don't need it no more I know why you're waiting Give me time to breathe Before you take my heart now and just get up and leave For I won't stop you I will open my door My heart is here waiting I don't need it no more For love makes a fool of me For love makes a clown of us Yes it does Yes it does Yes it does Yes it does You know it's worthless as worthless can be For love makes a fool of me For love makes a clown of us Yes it does Yes it does Yes it does Yes it does
