No other one can take your place 'Cause in my heart there is no space I locked my heart and gave you the key No other one beneath the sun Means that mush to me My love is yours to have and hold I wouldn't trade vows I made For silver and gold No other hand will cling to mine For other girls I have no time Although I'm free and my heart is young I'll give my love I'll give my hand To no other one My love is yours to have and hold I wouldn't trade vows I made For silver and gold
