You're the one I wanna talk about talk about Had a few but you knock them out knock em out Might just let you meet my mama now mama now Might just let you lock it lock it down 'Cause I've been loving how you are with me are with me Ain't no fussing ain't no arguing arguing Every plane needs a pilot pilot Tell me baby who you're flying with Like ooh ah wanna wanna be around you Got me breaking breaking all of my rules oh It's all the little things that you do That got me like ooh When I wake up You're the first thing that comes to mind Wanna see you like all the time Yeah we be loving so hard When I wake up You're the first thing that comes to mind Wanna see you like all the time Yeah we be loving so hard We be loving We be loving so hard We be loving We be loving so hard Ain't nobody love him like I love him Ain't nobody steal him Damn we be loving hard We be loving We be loving so hard We be loving We be loving so hard I'm missing when I'm holding him Missing when I'm kissing him Damn we be loving hard Tryna find find the words to say words to say To describe what you mean me mean me Side by side like the yin and yang yin and yang Like the stair up to my little wing And it be hard it'd hard at times hard at times But in the dark boy you are my light are my light The boom boom to my dynamite dynamite Baby you you are my ride or die Like ooh ah wanna wanna be around you Got me breaking breaking all of my rules oh It's all the little things that you do That got me like ooh When I wake up You're the first thing that comes to mind Wanna see you like all the time Yeah we be loving so hard When I wake up You're the first thing that comes to mind Wanna see you like all the time Yeah we be loving so hard We be loving We be loving so hard We be loving We be loving so hard Ain't nobody love him like I love him Ain't nobody's steal him Damn we be loving hard We be loving We be loving so hard so hard We be loving We be loving so hard so hard I'm missing when I'm holding him Missing when I'm kissing him Damn we be loving hard We be loving We be loving so hard We be loving We be loving so hard Ain't nobody love him like I love him Ain't nobody's steal him Damn we be loving hard We be loving We be loving so hard We be loving We be loving so hard I'm missing when I'm holding him Missing when I'm kissing him Damn we be loving hard
