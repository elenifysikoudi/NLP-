See inside my mind Life flashes when I sleep It's not all time oh these secrets I can keep When my eyes close You can come along I don't feel a thing Stuck in the river To spend tpo long Life is just too clean Hey Hey What a shame And it all happens in my dreams Nothing's ever what it seems And it all happens in my dreams You can only imagine what I see Yeaaaaah Now I can stay You waking my bed it's been one thing These people I create And I don't know where they end And in my bedroom Nothing goes wrong Safe under these sheets But I'll be up soon This sun is too strong My friends still look for me And it all happens in my dreams Nothing's ever what it seems And it all happens in my dreams You can only imagine what I see Eaaaaah
