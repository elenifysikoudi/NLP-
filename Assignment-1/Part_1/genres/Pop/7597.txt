Sky is white Trees are bare Been a while since you stood here You feel cold so alone Yet the wind whispers hello when it blows when it blows Fallen angel with shattered dreams Trying to make some sense of all you've seen Let it go Let it go Troubled soul Let it go Let it go Wounded spirit Troubled soul Fallen angel Let it all go Just believe and you will see all the good things your life can be And as dusk turns to dawn still you're battling your thoughts You feel lost so alone And you wonder can you carry on How amazing your life would be if you held on long enough to see Let it go Let it go Troubled soul Let it go Let it go Wounded spirit Troubled soul Fallen angel Let it all go Just believe and you will see all the good things your life can be Fallen angel you've made mistakes You can't keep living your life this way Let it go Let it go Troubled soul Let it go Let it go Wounded spirit Troubled soul Fallen angel Let it all go Just believe and you will see all the good things your life can be Wounded spirit Troubled soul Fallen angel Let it all go Just believe and you will see all the good things your life can be Let it go Let it go Troubled soul Let it go Troubled soul Let it go Let it go Troubled soul Let it go Let it go
