Here we go Here we go Im walking under the rainfall Im ready to get out of my fence I need a shift not a shelter This room is always empty I know what I need I keep on dreaming I look around myself Im trying to see my life And I keep on dreaming Searching for a brighter light 'Cause Im looking for my baby all day Im looking for my baby oh yeah 'Cause Im looking for my baby all day Im looking for my baby Ive never ever had enough 'Cause Im looking for my baby Im falling down in a fable My mind is gone Im flying away Im sitting over the rainbow My past is finally broken I feel so complete I keep on dreaming I look around myself Im trying to see my life And I keep on dreaming Searching for a brighter light 'Cause Im looking for my baby all day Im looking for my baby oh yeah 'Cause Im looking for my baby all day Im looking for my baby oh yeah 'Cause Im looking for my baby all day Im looking for my baby oh yeah 'Cause Im looking for my baby all day Im looking for my baby Ive never ever had enough 'Cause Im looking for my baby
