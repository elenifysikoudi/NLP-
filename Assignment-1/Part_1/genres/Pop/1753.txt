Voices are calling Voices are calling Voices calling Voices calling you There's a voice that is starting to call us There's a voice that we just can't ignore There's a bell that is ringing to tell us We're in a time and a place like never before There's a time when we're called to be ready It's a time when a sign will appear There's a time when we're called to be steady This is the moment we know that the moment is here Why is we are here Where is we will go Will we just disappear Answers we don't know Where will the future lead What will the future show How are we to proceed Answers we don't know Why is it we are here Where is it we will go Will we just disappear Answers we don't know Where will the future lead What will our future show How are we to proceed Answers we don't know Voices call from the old days Voices tell from the past Ancient laws and ancient old ways to recast Voices call from the future How will our future last Voices call from the future Is the future past Why is we are here Why is we are here Where is we will go Where is we will go Will we just disappear Will we just disappear Answers we don't know Where will the future lead Where will the future lead What will our future show What will our future show How are we to proceed Answers we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know Is there a better way Why is it we are here Do we go with the flow Where is we will go What is the price we will pay Will we just disappear Answers we don't know Is there a judgment day Why is we are here Is this the final show Where is it we will go When will the piper pay Answers we don't know Answers we don't know Answers we don't know The voices calling The voices calling you
