From the moment I saw you From the moment I looked into your eyes There was something about you I knew I knew That you were once in a lifetime A treasure near impossible to find And I know how lucky I am to have you 'Cause I've seen rainbows that could take your breath away The beauty of the setting sun on any given day And when it comes to shooting stars I have seen a few But I've never seen anything as beautiful as you I can't believe that I have you I can't believe that you're here in my arms I've been waiting a life time for you for you And I've dreamed about you Pictured in my mind who I would see But I never imagined just how beautiful you'd be 'Cause I've seen rainbows that could take your breath away Take your breath away The beauty of the setting sun on any given day any given day And when it comes to shooting stars I have seen a few But I've never seen anything as beautiful as you I've seen rainbows that could take your breath away Take your breath away The beauty of the setting sun on any given day And when it comes to shooting stars I have seen a few But I've never seen anything as beautiful But I've never seen anything as beautiful as you From the moment I saw you From the moment I looked into your eyes
