We were making history Breaking rules and breaking free Questioning the writing on the wall Got wind from the underground Laughing as we're falling down Soaking in the glory of it all But in dark times when we close our eyes It's a nightmare it's a nightmare When the sun don't shine we lose our minds But I swear we can get there We've got young blood Can't destroy us We make our own luck in this world We've got young blood No one chose us We make our own love in this world Someday we could run away See it all before the pictures fade Bottle up the feeling in a jar Pass around to all our friends We could breathe it in and out again Huddled in the backseat of the car But in dark times when we close our eyes It's a nightmare it's a nightmare When the sun don't shine we lose our minds But I swear we can get there We've got young blood Can't destroy us We make our own luck in this world We've got young blood No one chose us We make our own love in this world And our voices will get loud If they never loved you shut them out If you're lost you can be found If you follow me till you hear the sound Put em put em up now If you know we're never backing down We're never backing down We've got young blood Can't destroy us We make our own luck in this world We've got young blood No one chose us We make our own love in this world We've got young blood Can't destroy us We make our own luck in this world We've got young blood No one chose us We make our own love in this world Cause we've got young blood
