Where and why this journey lies With faded sighs for every mile I'm awake Hunger bleeds in each and everyone of us We chase our dreams unaware And I never had the chance to say no And I never had the chance to say no Don't walk away Where's the trust the one in us Entwined inclined and gladly blind Fade away Hunger bleeds in each and everyone of us And now I'm lost And I never had the chance to say no And I never had the chance to say no Don't walk away Say no
