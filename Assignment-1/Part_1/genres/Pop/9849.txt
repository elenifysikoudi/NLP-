When all you can do Is turn back around Walk over your footprints To what you've already found And call through the pieces That you left on the ground Cause everything is there but it's too close and it's too much It's not the fear of letting go but it's the fear of losing love And that's just how the story goes as you watch a life and fall Now what you have is you had and now it's gone you're on you're own And every time I try to walk away It's right there A channeling impulsive through my veins Brings me there For every little thing that we do you know I can't forget I can't forget it's you No I won't forget you No I never wanted To live things like this I pulled up these walls So you can see in But inside I'm dying oh I wanna let you in And every time I try to walk away It's right there A channeling impulsive through my veins Brings me there For every little thing that we do you know I can't forget I can't forget it's you No I won't forget you I won't I wont forget you I wont No I wont forget you Just slow down just slow down Just slow down just slow down Slow down and hold on And every time I try to walk away It's right there A channeling impulsive through my veins Brings me there For every little thing that we do you know I can't forget I can't forget it's you No I won't forget you
