I'm walking empty streets wondering if you ever knew there was another opportunity another solution for you A lonely voice said there will always be a Me you why weren't you here when dark grey returned to blue I will remember the smiles you gave to me and the voice said there will always be a We I'm not bitter but I've had so many better days I fell and suddenly I had noone to help me raise I had no chance there was no roses to dance on so many dreams was defeated They were broken and then they were gone I will remember the smiles you gave to me and the voice said there will always be a We Baby if I could have just one night I would have raised I would have told you there's no answers to your questions no written answer to what's right to do There is no answers
