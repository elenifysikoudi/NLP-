Get it Together That's What I say To me I put on the Pressure You could Do Better Be who you're supposed to be But that's when you came in Right when I needed you All of the things that I was believin' Not one of them were true You lifted my head up I was keeping my head down I didn't know love But I do now Cause you stood right there And then you Broke apart the lies You told me I had Something beautiful inside You brought to life The part of me I thought had died Cause you stood right there Until I saw me I saw me Through your eyes Saw me I saw me Through your eyes So this is living This is free Not keeping score Not anymore Not since you rescued me You lifted my head up I was keeping my head down I didn't know love But I do now Cause you stood right there And then you Broke apart the lies You told me I had Something beautiful inside You brought to life The part of me I thought had died Cause you stood right there Until I saw me I saw me Through your eyes Saw me I saw me Through your eyes You love me even when I fall apart I can't explain it That's just who you are Don't want perfection You just want my heart Cause you stood right there And then you Broke apart the lies You told me I had Something beautiful inside You brought to life The part of me I thought had died Cause you stood right there Until I saw me I saw me Through your eyes I saw me Through your eyes
