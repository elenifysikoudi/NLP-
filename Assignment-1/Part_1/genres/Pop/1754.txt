I wish I was in Carrickfergus Only for nights in Ballygran I would swim over the deepest ocean The deepest ocean for my love to find But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over And nor have I the wings to fly If I could find me a lonesome boatman To ferry me over my love and I My childhood days bring back sad reflections Of happy time I spent so long ago My boyhood friends and my own relations Have all passed on now like the melted snow So I'll spend my days in endless roving Soft is the grass my bed is free Ah to be home now in Carrickfergus On that long road down to the sea And in Kilkenny it is reported On marble stone there as black as ink With gold and silver I would support her But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink For I'm drunk today and I'm seldom sober A handsome rover from town to town Ah but I am sick now my days are numbered Come all ye young men and lay me down
