Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna really wanna go Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back I still have some pictures on my wall I still know the places where they're from I still find all answers in the trees I still feel the gum under my shoe How about hauling a bong full of miracles How about building a house on the moon Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back I still care about you being well I still wonder how we conquered hell I still love this nonsense team we make I still think we're twisted both the same How about hauling a bong full of miracles How about building a house on the moon Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna really wanna go Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna go back in time Do you really wanna really wanna go Do you really wanna go back in time
