Someday when we are wiser When the world's older When we have learned I pray someday we may yet Live to live and let live Someday life will be fairer Need will be rarer And greed will not pay God speed this bright millennium on its way Let it come someday Someday our fight will be won then We'll stand in the sun then That bright afternoon Till then on days when the sun is gone We'll hang on And we'll wish upon the moon There are somedays darken rivers Say we haven't got a plan But I'm praying for something better Is the one thing we all share Someday when we are wiser When the world's older When we have learned I pray someday we may yet Live to live and let live Someday life will be fairer Need will be rarer Greed will not pay God speed this bright millennium Let it come We will shall find a moon One day someday soon One day someday soon
