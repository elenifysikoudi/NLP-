I'm in control in this domain I feel at home inside the maze It keeps me safe it keeps me clean I step aside into the shade I'm here to watch to read the signs I walk alone I go unseen From place to place in fading light I move ahead along the tracks Pre millennium tension Your premonition Your guillotine Pre millennium tension Your premonition Your guillotine Pre millennium tension There's something wrong you feel it too I read your mind an open book I sense your fears it's in your bones A grinding stone a crushing load You dream at night in shallow sleep The demons breath is in the air It will not pass these are the days So pay attention you are not alone Pre millennium tension Your premonition Your guillotine
