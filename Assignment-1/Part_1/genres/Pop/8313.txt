Ah ah Everytime you say you're sorry Everytime you know you'll be forgiven One more time I've got to wonder Tell me why you want to kill me inside oh baby Give me something to remember Close to you Take me now Close to your body Ever and ever Close to you Love me now Close to your body Over and over Anytime you need me I don't wanna cry for loving I don't wanna feel so sad and lonely I can't stand it any longer Tell me why you keep on pushing me aside oh baby Give me something to remember Anytime you need me Everytime you leave me baby Everytime you take a piece of my heart Anytime you need me baby
