The muffled beat of distant music someone celebrates It's hunting season urbanised I wish I could be there Warmth and laughter the right amount of danger Johnnie Walker wisdom as Cohen used to say But it's pouring down with rain Do you remember Are you alive Do you still speak of deeds undone But it's pouring down with rain Do you remember Are you alive Do you still speak of deeds undone I used to be immortal I was innocent as a child my vision was unlimited I saw rivers on the Moon I had important things to say can't remember what they were Of all the things I did none had been done before But achievements never last Do you recall Do you dream Do you still need company But achievements never last Do you recall Do you dream Do you still need company I had a friend who knew the language of the future I'm told he lost his mind they say he went away Navigating empty streets astray among the lost A shadow in the corner of a stranger's eye But there's nothing left to learn Do you count the years Do you breathe Do you still watch the sunrise But there's nothing left to learn Do you count the years Do you breathe Do you still watch the sunrise My ambition took me further than I dreamt I don't even need a mirror anymore The penthouse pool is full of ice It should be flowers winter came too soon But you never liked to swim Do you feel safe Are you happy Do you still know my name But you never liked to swim Do you feel safe Are you happy Do you still know my name
