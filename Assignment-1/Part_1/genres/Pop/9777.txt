Fading out at black white I see technicolor lights Our names written in the sky Everything is ours tonight Gonna leave it all to faith Show it off like Phoebe Cates Live it up and blame our age Young enough to make mistakes Better than the movies Better than the movies Better than the movies What we get it is all we got It's better than the movies Better than the movies Better than the movies Better than the movies What we get it is all we got It's better than the movies Every moment is a dream Everytime we make a scene Life is like a silver screen We were born to take the lead Never gonna let it go Gonna give them all a show Walk into the after glow Stop and let the credits roll Better than the movies Better than the movies Better than the movies What we get it is all we got It's better than the movies Better than the movies Better than the movies Better than the movies What we get it is all we got It's better than the movies Better than the movies so much better than the movies Better than the movies so much better than the movies Better than the movies What we get it is all we got Is better than the movies Better than the movies better better Better than the movies so much better better Better than the movies What we get it is all we got Is better than the movies
