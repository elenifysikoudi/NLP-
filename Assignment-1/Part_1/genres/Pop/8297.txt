Don't love me baby I don't want you No no no no No no no no No no no no I see you walking under the rainfall Let you know that you're part of my life It's so hard to declare that it's over You're still in my mind in my mind No no no no Come on baby no no no no Get out of my life Come on baby no no no no Get out of my life of my life Don't love me baby I don't want you `Cause my heart can't resist tonight Don't love me baby I don't want you `Cause my heart can't resist tonight No no no no Hello baby hello I want to love you forever I hear you talk to me about the future But you're just fooling me with your lies Once you said that it would last forever With you by my side by my side No no no no Hello baby
