Here and now We are alone Time she will hold her breath Only the worms and angels Know our names But they have not found us Although they surround us I feel the distance closing Come along For you and I know We've lived through the centuries We've ridden the darkest horses All our lives We hunted our enemies We fought with a fallacy It's time we were all God's children Far away The galaxies soar The stars are exploding still I wish we could fly away Fly away Here and now For you and I know True love is deathless These crumbling days are ending By my side Let's walk in the garden We'll sleep in the ivy We'll be with the worms and angels
