Where did the time go Sun's still shining bright Lost in vertigo that's my kind of high Left a photograph off with your device Taken power back hope I get it right But when I step inside See your future where I belong But when I step inside See your future where I belong Technological unidentified One true miracle learning how to lie Led by memories born by satellite Thirst for energy wasted further nights But when I step inside See your future where I belong But when I step inside See your future where I belong Where did the time go Sun's still shining bright Lost in vertigo that's my kind of high Left a photograph off with your device Taken power back hope I get it right But when I step inside See your future where I belong But when I step inside See your future where I belong
