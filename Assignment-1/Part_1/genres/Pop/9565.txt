I saw you I think you saw me too You smiled at me like strangers do Then you disappeared in the crowd Are you that somebody Even if I dont love you Im not leaving this club without you And Ill do anything to get you To walk out of here with me I will treat you so good Leave you shaking Ill leave you breathless And Ill do anything to get you To walk out of here with me Stay with me stay until dawn One body and a rush of blood And your hands how I need your hands Are you that somebody Even if I dont love you Im not leaving this club without you And Ill do anything to get you To walk out of here with me I will treat you so good Leave you shaking Ill leave you breathless And Ill do anything to get you To walk out of here with me Im gonna lay you down Im gonna set you free Im gonna make you part of me Even if I dont love you Im not leaving this club without you And Ill do anything to get you To walk out of here with me I will treat you so good Leave you shaking Ill leave you breathless And Ill do anything to get you To walk out of here with me Lights bodies floor Lights bodies floor Lights bodies floor Lights bodies floor Lights bodies floor Lights bodies floor Lights bodies floor Lights bodies floor
