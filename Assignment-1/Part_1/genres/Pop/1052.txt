This town is full of monsters Holding hands with other monsters And attempting to be human beings Shuffling around the shops And waving at balloons This town is full of monsters Sitting on park benches Eating little packets of Sultanas Licking chocolate off their chubby little fingers And I don't know why It is they scare me but they do And the thing that really frightens me Is that all my friends from school Are turning into monsters Picking patterns out for curtains Making friends with all the other monsters Pushing little baby monsters Around the shops in prams This town is full of monsters Peeping out from under parked cars In multi storey car park Evil little eyes like fairy lights Blinking in the dark This town is full of monsters Making out with other monsters Picking sweet corn out of their teeth Dipping pissy little fingers In the pick n mix And I don't even know why It is it scares me but it does And the thing that really frightens me Is that the people I used to love Are turning into monsters Getting married having babies Telling me how great their life is And how happy I would be if I could Just be more like them
