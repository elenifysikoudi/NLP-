Stronghold in my poor soul You come around you come around you come after me And sweat cold tenfold and you come around after me I know you're alive throw me into the fire Man I should have known I should have known God damn you're alive threw me into the fire Man I should have known I should have known But I I I My body's full of guts and other stuff I I I My body's full enough To pull myself out to pull myself out To pull myself out to pull myself out Sad sword with the pitchfork Got me spun around spun around spun on the spit And move quick why pick from your mix You wash it down you wash it down and see how it sits I know you're alive throw me into the fire Man I should have known I should have known God damn you're alive threw me into the fire Man I should have known I should have known But I I I My body's full of guts and other stuff I I I My body's full enough To pull myself out to pull myself out To pull myself out to pull myself out You let the bottom drop out it's such a copout You led me to the slaughter but I'm someone's daughter You let the bottom drop out it's such a copout don't you feel ashamed You led me to the slaughter but I'm someone's daughter I'm someone's daughter You let the bottom drop out it's such a copout don't you feel ashamed You led me to the slaughter but I'm someone's daughter My body's full of guts and other stuff My body's full enough To pull myself out to pull myself out To pull myself out to pull myself out
