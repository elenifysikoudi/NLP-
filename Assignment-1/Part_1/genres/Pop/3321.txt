You're running in the night hiding from the light of day You say you're fine but I know better 'Cause you would never act that way If something wasn't wrong if something wasn't out of control And though you don't seem all that different than everybody else I know Coming from you that's nothing but strange behavior What you're going through causing that strange behavior so strange Something isn't right something's got you under it's spell And I would not be so suspicious if I didn't laiow you so well You might as well confess you know that I'm gonna find out So just don't keep on acting like you don't know what I'm talking about Coming from you that's nothing but strange behavior It's so strange you don't even talk to me Now you've changed you're nothing like you used to be Talk to me talk to me Coming from you that's nothing but strange behavior Coming from you that's nothing but strange behavior Strange talk to me 8x
