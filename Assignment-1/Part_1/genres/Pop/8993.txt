I drive through streets I could walk for weeks Full of life or full of loneliness Whose eyes will I watch from Today The day I signed My horror signed My glass was overflowing celebrate This rope's getting tighter And someone is pulling me back to the start Oh I need something that I know now Oh Just too far away from home now Oh Just a sight or sound to trust now Oh Keep it simple Keep me static Just enough to lose the panic Let me see the light again I have to know Where it goes Needing from the inside out This gut rot I could do without So sinister a pastime I have to know I have to go So cut the cord Throw overboard This history that claims of me My present and my future Both clear to see Both bound to be A replica this life so far I think it's time I raised the bar But this rope's getting tighter And someone is pulling me back to the start Oh I need something that I know now Oh Just too far away from home now Oh Just a sight or sound to trust now Oh Keep it simple Keep me static Just enough to lose the panic Let me see the light again I have to know I have to go Needing from the inside out This gut rot I could do without So sinister a pastime I have to know I have to go
