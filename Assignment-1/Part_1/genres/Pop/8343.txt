Inside of me a broken faith can you feel the cold can you feel the hate waiting for heavens intense embrace oh death get of my face Words I can't explain fill my mind so desperate for a feelin I can't find I'm numb I've never been before anger no control caged locked door Those lies drove us way too far in the end made us who we are I don't wanna be another example of a broken heart that've had enough Everything I thought I would be died along with your faith in me now addiction all that I can see I just wanna be independently Don't wait to long if this pain goes on I'll be waiting for you I know you'll never come it's my way of control I have no control shaking so blind feelings broken soul Those lies drove us way too far in the end made us who we are I don't wanna be another example of a broken heart that've had enough Painting a map on my wrists the beast in me exists you can't see the part of my that's dead this is all in my head it's all in my head
