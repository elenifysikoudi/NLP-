I've been ignoring you Oh why Looking the other way as you pass me by I've been exploring truth Sometime Finding out what went wrong Why you made me cry But if this fire alarm should start I'm gonna run to you We'll find the exit climb the stairs Into the sky so blue And if this building now should fall I will be crushed with you It's just a reflex after all But I wanna be with you I've been ignoring you Oh why Looking the other way as you pass me by I've been avoiding you Oh why everything's amber lit Since we said goodbye But if this fire alarm should start I'm gonna run to you We'll find the exit climb the stairs Into the sky so blue And if this building now should fall I will be crushed next to you In case you should forget to ask I'm still in love with you Aaahhh
