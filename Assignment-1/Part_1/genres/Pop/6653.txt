Stop searching sliding alone I know you're breathing on your own Star patterns burned in your side With ice melting you'll break in tonight No way there's no way You'll ever see what slipped through your fingers No chance there's no chance I guess I'm tired making up your mind for you So tired of making it seem real for you So tired wishing I could change for you You could be the perfect impostor Try to pass it off real You can take yourself anywhere you like But you'll always be there You can't escape what you carry in yourself Try hard but it's just a show Every time you conspire to fool yourself You'll live but will you have a smile Oh no You're in the light again Too late You're not ready for yourself Alright You're on the stage again Too bad Your mask isn't fully cured Oh no You're in the light again Too late You're not ready for yourself Alright You're on the stage again Too bad Your mask isn't fully cured Oh no I'm not too sure but you know I want you I know You're in the light again Too late I need to find my sanity for more You're not ready for yourself Alright I'm not too sure but you know I want you I know You're on the stage again Too bad I need to find Your mask isn't fully cured
