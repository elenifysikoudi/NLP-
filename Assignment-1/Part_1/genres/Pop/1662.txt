Don't take your love away from me Don't you leave my heart in misery If you go then I'll be blue 'cause breaking up his hard to do Remember when you held me tight And you kissed me all through the night Think of all that we've been through Breaking up is hard to do They say that breaking up is hard to do Now I know I know that it's true Don't say that this is the end Instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again I beg of you don't say goodbye Can't we give our love another try Come on baby let's start a new 'cause breaking up is hard to do I beg of you don't say goodbye Can't we give our love another try Come on baby let's start a new 'cause breaking up is hard to do Breaking up is hard to do
