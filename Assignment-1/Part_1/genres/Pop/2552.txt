In the death of the atmosphere they all stood in a row Kicking one another calling out names And crying about the don't know Oh I'm alone if I know it I'm alone if I I show it So army men pick up your feet We cannot settle for a quick defeat Oh don't dare cry So lose some battles but win out the war 'Cause tears are selfish and you aren't anymore Oh don't dare cry In the absence of gratitude we all feel alone And we all become prisoners And that disgusting formidable road Oh don't dare cry Oh I'm alone if I know it I'm alone if I show it So army men pick up your feet We cannot settle for a quick defeat Oh don't dare cry So lose some battles but win out the war 'Cause tears are selfish and you aren't anymore Oh don't dare cry cry oh cry oh cry Oh don't dare cry So army men pick up your feet We cannot settle for a quick defeat Oh don't dare cry So lose some battles but win out the war 'Cause tears are selfish and you aren't anymore Oh don't dare cry
