Winter has come back again Feels like the season won't end My faith is tired tonight And I won't try to pretend I've got it all figured out That I don't have any doubts I've got a busted heart I need You now Yeah I need You now Hold on to me Hold on to me Don't let me lose my way Hold on to me I am the wandering son Enough is never enough I keep chasing the wind Instead of chasing Your love I'm screaming out Your name Don't let me fall on my face I've got a busted heart I'm in need of a change Yeah I'm desperate for grace Hold on to me Hold on to me Hold on to me Don't let me lose my way Don't let me lose my way Hold on to me Broke Your heart a thousand times But You've never left my side You have always been here For me You never let me go You never let me go Don't ever let me go Hold on to me Hold on to me Hold on to me Don't let me lose my way Don't let me lose my way Hold on to me Hold on to me Hold on to me Hold on to me Don't let me lose my way Don't let me lose my way Hold on to me Winter will come to an end Soon the season will end I surrender tonight You meet me right where I am
