I've got time to kill Like we all do I've got to fill it up When I mill about Like we all do It's on the heels of my thought Convenience takes its place Like it always does With the sun into the moon You play my only tune Like you always do It keeps my feet upon the ground And you can stop But you won't And you can stop But you won't Eyes off the ground Look at this world around us You tell a tale It writes our history for us I run away You pull the sheets around us I put this out But it is just so under us And you can stop But you won't And you can stop But you won't
