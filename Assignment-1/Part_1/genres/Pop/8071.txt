I'm in Dreamsville holding you I'm dreaming you Just we two alone in love in Dreamsville Time is new we're here to love A and we do We can see the rest of the world below us from our pink cloud There's no boundary to this magic light As we go exploring hand in hand in dreamy Dreamsville Far away And here we love Here we'll stay
