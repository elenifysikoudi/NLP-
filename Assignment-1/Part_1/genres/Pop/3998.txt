Helen of Troy was the kind of girl Who really had it all Not a care in the world but her head was turned And forever changed She said one love is lost but another is found So just take the keys and let's just go birds fly south Nothing ventured nothing gained It's all about love So I'm not to blame I'm not to blame She said I've dotted my I's and I've crossed my T's Had time for friends when they needed me I try to make sense of senseless things Try to live how I believe And of course I leave things behind that I'll regret But there's time enough for new things yet for new things yet When the dust covers the sun And all you hope for is undone Will you turn and say Oh nothing ventured nothing gained It was all for love so love is to blame Love is to blame love is to blame Love is to blame love is to blame Love is to blame love is to blame love is to blame When the dust covers the sun And all you hope for is undone Will you turn and say Oh nothing ventured nothing gained It was all for love so love is to blame Love is to blame When the dust covers the sun And all you hope for is undone Will you turn and say Oh nothing ventured nothing gained It was all for love so love is to blame Love is to blame Love is to blame Love is to blame Love is to blame Love is to blame Love is to blame Love is to blame
