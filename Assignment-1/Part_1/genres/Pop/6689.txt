What can I do to show my love to you I'd face erormous pain run through the wind and rain Girl anything I'll do The smile on your face is like a joy that can't be placed It runs all over me and takes a hold of me Don't let it fade away 'Cause I keep thinkin 'bout ya every night in every way Thinkin to myself it might be too late It's gonna be real hard I hope that I can take it I really don't know how I'm gonna make it I can't go on I can't go on without you I can't go on without you What can I say to tell ya that I'm sorry The thing that I said can't be true oh lady My mind wasn't thinkin when I let you Walk out that door 'Cause babe babe I love you And you know it I'll try to find a way I can make it A way to go on without you here I'll time the hours till you come back And count the days till you appear It's gonna be real hard I hope that I can take it I really don't know how I'm gonna make it I can't go on I can't go on without you I can't go on without you I can't go on I can't go on without you I can't go on without you Now I agree that I never should have let you go And if I hurt you then I'm sorry I didn't know I'll try to be a better man the one you care for And if that's not enough just tell me I'll give you more So smoothly lay back is what I'm gonna do 'Cause baby I can't go on without you I can't go on I can't go on without you I can't go on without you I can't go on I can't go on I need to feel your love I can't go on I need to feel your love Just as simple as holding your hand Can't go on I can't go on I can't go on without you I can't go on without you I can't go on I can't go on without you I can't go on
