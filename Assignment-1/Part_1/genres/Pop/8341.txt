I saw this guy but never figured out what was on his mind I thought the wind would lead him to what he gotta find but the truth never tells itself the lies does and he will never truly find himself after this loss So he copes with his problems his past keeps ruining and the tears that fell it's so fucking grueling the way he feels he's not strong enough all the memories from a troubled past it's too much And from another loss he cries oh how he hate goodbyes from all the suffering and lies oh how he hate goodbyes This world have always treatened him like dirt at night he ask himself if he even belong on this earth every single day that pass is a day where he fights only the drug they offer can let him reach the new hights Just one minute he's down so he turns around injects the drug into an open wound the message is so clear he wanna die and his friends would never get to say goodbye And from another loss he cries oh how he hate goodbyes from all the suffering and lies oh how he hate goodbyes waken in a hospital bed it's pain in his eyes there's pain in his head his family have never taken care of him and every one turns their back in fear of him The story he bears are full of pain from his childhood the parent that left and everyone that misunderstood he was left as a child he was born to be wild could never forget this family that never smiled And from another loss he cries oh how he hate goodbyes from all the suffering and lies oh how he hate goodbyes He's moving away from the pain away from the rain away from the places that drives him insane gonna find a new start with those who cares trying to forget the past and the tears Now all he gotta see is goodbye and from another loss he cries oh how he hate goodbyes from all the suffering and lies oh how he hate goodbyes
