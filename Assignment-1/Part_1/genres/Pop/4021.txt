We slept in this room together but now you're gone And it's so quiet I turn the TV on We lived in this room together we painted the walls Now time doesn't stand still it crawls And I'm afraid to sleep 'Cause if I do I dream of you And dreams are always deep On the pillow where I weep I never realized how much I was in love with you Until you started sleeping with someone new Last night I dreamed again and you were there You kissed my face you touched my hair And I'm afraid to sleep 'Cause if I do I dream of you And dreams are always deep On the pillow where I weep Lying alone in the darkness With the memory in my head There's a big hole where my heart is And a lonely feeling rollin round my bed And I'm afraid to sleep 'Cause if I do I dream of you I'm afraid to sleep 'Cause if I do I dream of you And dreams are always deep On the pillow where I weep On the pillow where I weep I'm afraid to sleep
