A voice in the night Baby I hear you calling A light in the dark And I remember the pain in my heart Claro de luna A voice in the night Baby I hear you calling A light in the dark And I remember the pain in my heart A passion inside Said that you loved me and would never give up But you told me less oh baby Changed your mind ran away and said goodbye Claro de luna I'll never forget my baby Claro de luna I'll never forget my sweetest night Claro de luna I don't want to cry But tears keep on falling I was so blind I should known there was something to hide I gave you my life And all that you wanted from me was a night I've opened my eyes now baby You played with my heart now I break down and cry Claro de luna I'll never forget my baby Claro de luna I'll never forget my sweetest night A voice in the night Baby I hear you calling A light in the dark And I remember the pain in my heart Claro de luna I'll never forget my baby Claro de luna I'll never forget my sweetest night Claro de luna I'll never forget my baby Claro de luna I'll never forget my sweetest night Claro de luna
