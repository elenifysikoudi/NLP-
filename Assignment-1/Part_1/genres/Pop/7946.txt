Quiet nights of quiet stars Quiet chords from my guitar Floating on the silence that surrounds us Quiet nights and dreams Quiet walks by quiet streams And a window looking on the Mountains and the sea how lovely This is where I want to be Here with you so close to me Till the final flicker of life's ember I who was lost and lonely Believing life was only a bitter tragic joke Have found with you The meaning of existence oh my love This is where I want to be Here with you so close to me Till the final flicker of life's ember I who was lost and lonely Believing life was only a tragic joke Have found with you The meaning of existence oh my love
