Looking at me Youde never know Im fragile Looking at me You wouldnt guess that I might be yeah Afraid to crash afraid to burn as freely As the last time I let go All the shadows and suspicions that may appear to you as ice Are not me being cold just thinking twice I can build a big blue wall No way in and no way out But leave it up to you to prove me wrong Im afraid that I could crumble Once the stones begin to move It happens when you been too blue too long Theres a breeze Thats flickering the candles And I can breath A little deeper for a change yeah Theres a chance outside this isolation Ill be free to be held again But if I am reluctant and if I begin to cry Its because Im unaccustomed to the light I can build a big blue wall No way in and no way out But leave it up to you to prove me wrong Im afraid that I could crumble Once the stones begin to move It happens when you been too blue too long You can stand in the street light But live in the corners and no one knows Youre not there You can smile for the camera And make impression And no one knows You dont care I can build a big blue wall No way in and no way out But leave it up to you to prove me wrong Im afraid that I could crumble Once the stones begin to move It happens when you been too blue too long
