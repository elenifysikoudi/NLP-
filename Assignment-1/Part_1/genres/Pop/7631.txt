Only you to me have the key Can it be I'm dreaming Now you're here with me I can't believe Tell me am I dreaming It's the right time we both know For you to be stepping back into my life We wasn't happy Couldn't make it the first time I'll always be thinking of I'll always be dreaming of Only you We did what we had to do We said what we had to say And with a last embrace We just turned and walked away We did what we had to do We said what we had to say Now that we're back again We won't make the same mistakes I know it was the right thing to do When we let each other go If we were hurting And we had nowhere else to go If we just carried on Let it go on and on There'd be nothing else to build on We did what we had to do We said what we had to say And with a last embrace We just turned and walked away It was then I felt my heart breaking 'Cause we let each other go For we couldn't see our future Or what it had to hold We did what we had to do We said what we had to say Now that we're back again We won't make the same mistakes Baby if we take a chance This time we can make it last Sometimes love works a second time around That's what we're finding out
