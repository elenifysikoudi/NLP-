As sweet as a plum and lovely as dawn Rolling its tongue over its gums Like tiger and me as happy as could be Sat out on the porch As the whole of the sky Clouds quietly over And it starts to cry Softly on my shoulder We don't want to grow up But we have to grow up As sad as I am I do understand I do understand it just makes me sad My tiger my heart We're growing apart We're trying to be friends But it's hard sometimes To be friends with something that eats butterflies And pencil sharpeners And I think it would be happier being free My tiger my friend My little godsend I know someday we'll be happy again
