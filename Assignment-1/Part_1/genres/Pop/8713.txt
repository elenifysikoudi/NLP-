Last night I dreamt of your hands in mine Your touch made me feel alive You told me that I was your favorite mistake Our destinies intertwined And it felt so real Seeing our love it's just begun And it makes me feel so warm I could melt inside Hold me close Hold me deep inside your heart now Dream with me Close your eyes and you will see Our rapture of love our rapture of love I woke up this morning your hand in mine And gazed into your eyes You smiled so coy and you moved in slowly A kiss to stop all time And this feels so real Seeing our love it's just begun And it makes me feel So warm I could melt inside Hold me close Hold me deep inside your heart now Dream with me Close your eyes and you will see Our rapture of love Is this real Have I found my love This is real I found my love Is this real Have I found my love This is real I found my love Hold me close Hold me deep inside your heart now Dream with me Close your eyes and you will see Hold me close Hold me deep inside your heart now Dream with me Close your eyes and you will see Our rapture of love Our rapture of love our rapture of love Our rapture of love our rapture of love
