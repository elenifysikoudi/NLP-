Baby seem like everywhere I go I see you From your eyes I smile it's like I breathe you Helplessly I reminisce don't want to Compare nobody to you Boy I try to catch myself but I'm outta control Your sexiness is so appealing I can't let it go baby Know that I can't get over you cause everything I see is you And I don't want no substitute baby I swear it's deja vu Know that I can't get over you cause everything I see is you And I don't want no substitute baby I swear it's deja vu Baby I can't go anywhere without thinking that you're there Seems like you're everywhere it's true gotta be having deja vu 'Cause in my mind I want you here get on the next plane I don't care I'm missing you that I'm having deja vu Boy I try to catch myself but I'm outta control Your sexiness is so appealing I can't let it go Know that I can't get over you cause everything I see is you And I don't want no substitute baby I swear it's deja vu Know that I can't get over you cause everything I see is you And I don't want no substitute baby I swear it's deja vu Know that I can't get over you cause everything I see is you And I don't want no substitute baby I swear it's deja vu Know that I can't get over you cause everything I see is you And I don't want no substitute baby I swear it's deja vu
