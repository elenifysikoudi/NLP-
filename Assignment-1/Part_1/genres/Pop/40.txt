Every step I make And every breath I take I took cause I can't wait To be closer to you Baby you're so sweet You give me cavities I get a stomach ache If I can't be with you At night I fall asleep And I don't want to wake up 'Cause you are in my dreams A heavenly creation In the body that I only want to share with you Hey Everything I do is just for you Countin every second till we rendezvous And I can't wait To give my love to you 'Cause everything I do is just for you Baby we will never finish To be continued Separation can't change The love I feel for you I'm gonna definitely be affectionate Snuggle up tonight let's get real intimate 'Cause only you can satisfy my appetite 'Cause when it comes to love You get me get so excited When I taste your lips My body melts in bliss every time You are my you are my Universe universe Everything I want and Everything I need and Everything worth waiting for For better or for worse Constant craving Your love enslaves me oh Give it to me baby I want to give it to you Give it to me baby I can't wait 'Cause everything I do is just for you Everything I do is just for you Countin every second till we rendezvous I can't wait 'Cause everything I do is just for you Everything I do is just for you Countin every second till we rendezvous And I can't wait To give my love to you 'Cause everything I do is just for you
