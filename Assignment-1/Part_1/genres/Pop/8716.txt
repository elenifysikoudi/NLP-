It's not quite disaster But we're in the dark Let's not wait till after It all goes too far 'Cause I'm a little blurry I can't find you lately When will we appear clearly I know that something unseen Was stuck in between What do we mean anymore And what have we won By coming undone What are we fighting for Help me 'Cause I don't want to lose you now Help me 'Cause I don't want to let you down But this love has taken too much It's breaking us bit by bit I I don't see the point of it I help me see the point of it Love's not survival Not when it begins Are we still untitled Or is this the end 'Cause look what we've undone now If you could reach me somehow You would find I'm still yours now I know that something unseen Was stuck in between What do we mean anymore And what have we won By coming undone What are we fighting for Help me 'Cause I don't want to lose you now Help me 'Cause I don't want to let you down But this love has taken too much It's breaking us bit by bit Oh I I don't see the point of it Help me help me see the point of it
