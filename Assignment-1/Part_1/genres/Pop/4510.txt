I remember when I saw your face You caught me smiling I had to look away And I could not resist the promise of your kiss Now dream is all I do of paradise and you I wanna be where the sun is shining Amore mio I wanna have you there beside me Amore mio Now those lazy summer days They seem so far away Wherever you may go Ti amo I remember sunsets on fire Nights of endless passion Burning with desire I close my eyes and I can see your smile Sky is clear the ocean blue I'm in paradise with you I wanna be where the sun is shining Amore mio I wanna have you there beside me Amore mio Now those lazy summer days They seem so far away Wherever you may go Ti amo Take me back to where the magic is Let me hold you in my arms Under the stars Rainy days and lonely nights Only darkness there's no light Without you in my life Ti amo I wanna be where the sun is shining Amore mio I wanna have you there beside me Amore mio Now those lazy summer days They seem so far away Wherever you may go Ti amo
