Away in a manger No crib for his bed The little Lord Jesus Laid down his sweet head The stars in the sky Looking down where he lay The little Lord Jesus Asleep on the hay The cattle are lowing The poor baby wakes But little Lord Jesus No crying he makes I love Thee Lord Jesus Look down from the sky And stay by my cradle Till morning is nigh Be near me Lord Jesus I ask Thee to stay Close by me for ever And love me I pray Bless all the dear children In Thy tender care And take us to Heaven To live with Thee there And take us to Heaven To live with Thee there
