Oh I've been thinking past But all I got is now But it's all good tea no it's not And he really freaks me out Whatever that's about But it's all good tea no it's not But it's all gold tea til it stops I always punctuate The words I used to hate But it's all good tea yeah it's not But it's all good tea til it stops Sleep nobody sleeps Nobody sleeps That's always sideways They want you to Then inside it's true The books I read they make faces They are so mean It's all good tea then it's not It's all gold tea til it stops Sleep nobody sleeps Nobody sleeps That's always sideways Everything I ever wanted Everything I always asked for Just turned to dust I'm looking now I'm headed in I thought that I was built to win But I don't but I don't Sleeps nobody sleeps Nobody sleeps Well nobody Sleep nobody sleeps Nobody sleeps That's always sideways That's always sideways That's always sideways Ba da Ba da Ba da
