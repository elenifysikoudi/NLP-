"The moonlight dances among the trees The campfire glows in the autumn breeze and I am lost in my thoughts of you Remember me recuerde me A comrade strums on sad guitar My mind is drifting to where you are I'm holding you as I used to do Remember me recuerde me Mi amore So long ago so far away each night I pray ""volvero los dias passados"" I promise you that come what may those days will stay ever in my memory In all this world I could never find the love that I had to leave behind But duty calls so whate'er befalls Remember me recuerde me mi amor "
