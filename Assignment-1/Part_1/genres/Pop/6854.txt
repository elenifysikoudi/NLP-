Violins played by the wind are crying Softly the silvery rain is sighing Slowly the flame of our love is dying It rains on our love and we must part Ciao ciao Bambina the rain is falling Once more I kiss you and then goodbye Our love was just like a fairy story But all its glory must pass us by Are raindrops trembling upon your face dear Or are they teardrops for the love we knew Ciao ciao Bambina my heart is calling While rain is falling I cry with you Ciao ciao Bambina the rain is falling Once more I kiss you and then goodbye Our love was just like a fairy story But all its glory must pass us by Are raindrops trembling upon your face dear Or are they teardrops for the love we knew Ciao ciao Bambina my heart is calling While rain is falling I cry with you
