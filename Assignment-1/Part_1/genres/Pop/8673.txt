He's not looking for you anymore He's just trying to come down And get his head back on You say goodbye before you're in too deep You twist your body like a knife And struggle to be free And it don't take long To lose someone CHORUS Amanda What you gonna do now' Amanda What you gonna do' Go out and get that new tatoo Hey I know it will look good on you Amanda You look like trouble when you hit the street You don't look in no one's eyes You just walk on by Smokin the guys like a cigarette You put them out before the light Gets in your eyes Amanda What you gonna do now' Amanda What you gonna do' Go down to that place you go Where the boys hang out and they all know Amanda You walk in like you got nothin to say One by one Amanda blow them away CHORUS
