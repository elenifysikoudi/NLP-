Make up your mind Where do we start Thinking of me You're not allowed Dangerous crowds Pressing me into unthinkable voids Are you a curse From bad to worse Our affair Helpless as I'm Trying to react You were the worst idea I ever had Sometimes I wonder how I landed in a mess like this And then you're walking through the door and not a thing goes wrong Sometimes you wonder how we landed in a mess like this And bells they ring and there's a day when they will ring for us Give me your heart I'll give you mine Hopeless exchange Chapter erased They say we're young Too young to marry Not too young to die Sometimes I wonder how I landed in a mess like this And then you're walking through the door and not a thing goes wrong Sometimes you wonder how we landed in a mess like this And bells they ring and there's a day When they will ring for us Wonder how we landed in a mess like this Walking through the door and not a thing goes wrong Wonder how we landed in a mess like this Ring there's a day when they will ring for Sometimes you wonder how we landed in a mess like this And then you're walking through the door and not a thing goes wrong Sometimes we wonder how we landed in a mess like this And bells they ring there's a day when they will ring for us
