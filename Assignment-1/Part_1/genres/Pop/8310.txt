This is a dream So let me take you on a trip This is a dream a virtual reality There's a crazy world around me You know the way I feel Tell me why we don't believe In love and dreams Every time I long to save me Never find the things I need Keep on searching for some light That shade my fears This is a dream a virtual reality Virtual reality is walking around you Virtual reality is looking for you Virtual reality is walking around you Virtual reality is looking for you Is looking for you is looking for you When you feel yourself in danger I feel the same way too Time is getting our We got to see it through This is a dream A virtual reality Virtual reality is walking around you Virtual reality is looking for you Virtual reality is walking around you Virtual reality is looking for you Is looking for you is looking for you So let me take you on a trip Let me take you on a ride A virtual reality
