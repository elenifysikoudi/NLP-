Six o'clock and I'm falling down And it must be miles on the stereo She told me that it's over now pack the bags for Mexico Oh I couldn't believe how quickly time has come and gone Again again Searching through the passing clouds and I know it's you I'm looking for And I wish one would turn around And I see the smile that keep me warm Always treasure the nights that we have spent under the Moon Just me and you Oh I'll be standing here on the darkest side You just left me here where the shadows hide So I count the stars searching for a sign And I asked myself What if you and I had never said goodbye Ooooh oh goodbye oooh oh Six o'clock in the morning now when I'm waking up to catch a flight I thought I'd get to you somehow But I forgot to call and didn't just right See your face to say the things I should've said to you all along Oh I'll be standing here on the darkest side You just left me here where the shadows hide So I count the stars searching for a sign And I asked myself What if you and I had never said goodbye A thousand miles away yet everyday I run to find you And bring you close to me so you can see that you're the one Who gives me everything I'll ever need you make so complete I'll give you all of me If you don't say goodbye Ooooh oh goodbye oooh oh I'll be standing here on the darkest side You just left me here where the shadows hide So I count the stars searching for a sign And I asked myself What if you and I had never said goodbye Ooooh oh goodbye oooh oh
