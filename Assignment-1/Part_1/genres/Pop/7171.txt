Now the fire has gone away I face you with a broken pen And sympathy and gratitude Dissolve into disarray I relied undisguised Followed all you'd say Was your weakness momentary you're devotion temporary It's a question of taste Like a slap in the face Let the vain do what they do Did you laugh at my innocence Custom made but gone astray Erase you with a pencil head I'm bulletproof now I hide But somehow I was happy then Do you know how lost how lost how lost Was your weakness momentary Your devotion temporary It's a question of taste like a slap in the face It's a question of taste let the vain do What they do did you laugh at my innocence I don't want to live forever I just want some oh oh oh oh I don't want to live forever I just want some oh oh oh oh
