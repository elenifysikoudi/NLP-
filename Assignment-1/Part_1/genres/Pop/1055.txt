I bruise like a peach I mumble when I speak I'm in the gutter lookin at the stars I've always been in love with you I look tough enough But if you hold me up to the light You can see my broken heart I've always been in love with you They're just paper cuts I'll sellotape them up And bandage them with cotton wool and glue Paper cuts I shouldn't beat myself up Over little things the way I do Nothing stays the same I wish I could remain the color Of the cherry blossom tree I've always been in love with you I always used to leave Before I went to sleep But now I just pass out watching TV I've always been in love with you They're just paper cuts I'll sellotape them up And bandage them with cotton wool and glue Paper cuts I shouldn't beat myself up Over little things the way I do Just be careful when you shine Because if you throw a light On something magical It disappears Paper cuts I'll sellotape them up And bandage them with cotton wool and glue They're just paper cuts I shouldn't beat myself up Over little things the way I do I bruise like a peach I mumble when I speak I'm in the gutter lookin at the stars I've always been in love with
