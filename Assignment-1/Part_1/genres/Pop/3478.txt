Verse 1 I met you on the sidewalk I hoped you were the way you were before Don't give into the small talk Don't give up on the things that we adore Oh yes you know I'm like that I like you like the way we were before Still got some things to forget These days just walking around here's such a chore Chorus We both need it all and more Just the way we were before Verse 2 I'm pleased to see that old walk Skipping all the cracks on the concrete These days have gotten real tough like you ever seemed I've been around a few blocks I chased away the cobwebs in the street I wind up all the old clocks So we can say we never skipped a beat Chorus Cause we like that Just like the way we were before It's all mixed up But that's just what we have in store You can't fix that
