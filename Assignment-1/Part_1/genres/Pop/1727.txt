Home home home from the sea Angels of mercy answer our plea And carry us home home home from the[ sea Carry us safely home from the sea On a cold winters night With a storm at its height The lifeboat answered the call They pitched and they tossed Till we thought they were lost As we watched from the harbor wall Though the night was pitch black There was no turning back For someone was waiting out there But each volunteer Had to live with his fear As they joined in a silent prayer As they battled their way Past the mouth of the bay It was blowing like never before As they gallantly fought Every one of them thought Of loved ones back on the shore Then a flicker of light And they knew they were right There she was on the crest of a wave She's an old fishing boat And she's barely afloat Please God there are souls we can save And back in the town In a street that runs down To the sea and the harbor wall They'd gathered in pairs At the foot of the stairs To wait or the radio call And just before dawn When all hope had gone Came a hush and a faraway sound 'Twas the coxswain he roared All survivors on board Thank God and we're homeward bound
