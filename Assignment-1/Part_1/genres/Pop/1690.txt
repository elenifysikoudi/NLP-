I've been playing some old records that I found in Grandpa's trunk Beside a wind up gramophone beneath a pile of junk And in that dusty attic I enjoyed a music show Listening to the melodies of eighty years ago Doo wacka doo wacka doo wacka doo wacka doo The band would play Doo wacka doo wacka doo wacka doo They'd danced the night away I long for all the magic and the days of cabaret Bring back those good old melodies of yesterday Bring back those good old melodies of yesterday In my youth I studied music and it taught me how to sing Bella signora They took me to the opera and I loved that kind of thing But then I'd listen to the stories that my grandpa used to tell About the Roaring Twenties and the songs he knew so well Doo wacka doo wacka doo wacka doo wacka doo The band would play Doo wacka doo wacka doo wacka doo They'd danced the night away I long for all the magic and the days of cabaret Bring back those good old melodies of yesterday Bring back those good old melodies of yesterday Then he'd talk about the flappers and the way they used to dance About the bootleg liquor and the ballrooms of romance Then later in the movies there's dancing everywhere My grandpa said he dreamed that he could move like Fred Astaire Oh doo wacka doo wacka doo wacka doo wacka doo The band would play Doo wacka doo wacka doo wacka doo They'd danced the night away I long for all the magic and the days of cabaret Bring back those good old melodies of yesterday Bring back those good old melodies of yesterday
