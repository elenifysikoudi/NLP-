Today I can't seem to find what I'm searching for Oh well maybe tomorrow I wait devious thoughts but no inspiration at all I have shut down Generations lost in the haze of these apathy days When everyone falls Segregation someone to blame But the problems remain when everyone falls Somewhere looking for shelter I still can't find myself I am alone Aware is it my color or culture who can tell Should we be hated for ourselves where should we go Generations lost in the haze of these apathy days When everyone falls Segregation someone to blame But the problems remain when everyone falls Are you with me sometime or never Are you with me sometime or never Or never never never don't let me down Generations lost in the haze of these apathy days When everyone falls Segregation someone to blame But the problems remain when everyone falls Generations lost in the haze of these apathy days When everyone falls Today tomorrow sometimes never Today tomorrow sometimes never Today tomorrow sometimes never Today tomorrow sometimes never Today tomorrow sometimes never
