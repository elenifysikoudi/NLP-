Sitting here staring at the wall Another lonely tear falls I'm trying to write you this song But I can hardly see the page at all Cause it's breaking my heart When I look in your eyes And I don't see me anymore When you're all I'm living for Baby tell me that you still believe That you still love me The way I love you If you took your love away from me You know I would die Cause I'm not ready for goodbye Baby please pick up the phone Tell me I'm crazy I got it all wrong I don't know what I'm gonna do I don't know how to live without you You are the first song My heart ever heard And baby I I believed every word You are my heart my soul my world Baby tell me that you still believe That you still love me The way I love you If you took your love away from me You know I would die Cause I'm not ready for goodbye Every breath that I take Every beat of my heart You know it's all for you I wanna hold you I wanna love you Forever and always Baby tell me that you still believe That you still love me The way I love you If you took your love away from me You know I would die Cause I'm not ready for goodbye Baby tell me that you still believe That you still love me The way I love you If you took your love away from me You know I would die Cause I'm not ready for goodbye Goodbye goodbye goodbye
