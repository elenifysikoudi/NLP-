Noel Noel Noel Noel Born is the King of Israel The first Noel the angel did say Was to certain poor shepherds In fields as they lay In fields where they Lay keeping their sheep On a cold winter night That was so deep Noel Noel Noel Noel Born is the King of Israel They looked up and saw a star Shining in the east beyond them far And to the earth it gave great light And so it continued both day and night Noel Noel Noel Noel Born is the King of Israel This star drew nigh to the northwest Over Bethlehem it took its rest And there it did both stop and stay Right over the place where Jesus lay Noel Noel Noel Noel Born is the King of Israel
