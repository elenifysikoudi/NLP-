I dreamed you were riding a train to Astoria I dreamed that you swallowed a pill called Euphoria Lips are for lying your eyes are to kill Spoons come from Denmark the knives from Bavaria A plateful of promise a spoonful of fun A thimble of drowsy a face full of charm Send me a rainbow send me the word The spoons come from Denmark the knives from Bavaria Lalalalaa lala lalalala Lala lalalaa lala lalalala Lalalalaa lala lalalala Lala lalalalaa lala lalalala Comb me and brush me divide me in two Drink me and drown me I like you I do I'm orange I'm orange I'm orange I'm blue I love him I love him I love him I do Lalalalaa
