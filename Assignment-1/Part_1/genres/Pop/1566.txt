"When I wake in the morning I put on my Jordans Turn up my swag and I whistle When I head out the door in my new Ralph Lauren I twist my cap back and I whistle ay ay When my mama yelles ""No"" cause I ware my pants low I chuck the deuce up and I whistle When them boys in the yard ice grillin me hard I look up in the sky and I whistle ay ay Dobadoba ay HEY There's no other way it's a way of life You gonna live right now somehow and whistle like it's gon'be ok Yeah we can make it right and if you get knocked down get up and whistle like whistle like ohohoh Nanananana nanananannana When a girl pass by and she give me the eye I whistle I whistle When a song comes on but I can't sing along I whistle I whistle it goes One a lip two a lip three a lip four Four a lip three a lip two a lip blow Everybody here we go oo Do the whistle HEY There's no other way It's a way of life You gotta live right now somehow and whistle like listen It's gon'be ok Yeah we can make it right and if you get knocked down get up and whistle like Whistle like nanananana nanananana ohohohoh whistle like"
