"Twilight in symphony it's as well its what you don't see So plain you're impatient now I wait in your eyes It's in the way that your love is forgiving Ageless your time won't come you're as beautiful as the sun Tables they turn so slow you were once now you burn It's in the way that love is forsaken now you see the profit how do you regret ""Bring your mortar back I want to seal the eyes the lines and cracks tell me I'm not loved I love the giver of my soul"" It's in the way that love is forsaken you've seen the progress now do you regress It's in the way that your love is forbidden you've seen this progress If I blame its not my fault It's on the outside Everafter"
