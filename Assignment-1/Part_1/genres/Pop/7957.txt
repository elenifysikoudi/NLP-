Build your dreams to the stars above But when you need someone true to love Don't go to strangers darling Come to me Play with fire til your fingers burn When there's no place for you to turn Don't go to strangers darling Come to me For when you hear a call To follow your heart You'll follow your heart I know I've been through it all For I'm an old hand And I'll understand if you go So make your mark for your friends to see But when you need more than company Don't go to strangers darling Come to me
