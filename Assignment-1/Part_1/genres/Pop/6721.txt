"Sometimes I stop Take a look at myself And realize just what I've done It's not that I'm better than It's just that I thought ""I can "" I played the odds and I won So I have no right to complain Or feel sorry for myself When so many more have less I look around And I realize I am so blessed Yes I am blessed I am so blessed Yes I am blessed It's hard to concieve People look up to me And somehow it makes them believe That as long as you dream No matter what life may bring With God you can do anything There may be times when the world seems so cold And times when I cannot rest I don't complain Cause I know inside that I am so blessed In the morning when I rise Yes I am blessed I am so blessed I am blessed Yes I'm blessed Of all of the places I've been And people that I've met A lifetime of memories I'll never forget I look back with no regrets cause I am so blessed Yes I am blessed I am so blessed Yes I am blessed Blessed OOoohhhhh "
