She loves the finer things gold and diamond rings Give her the moon but wouldn't be enough She wants the perfect man has a perfect plan And nothing I do could ever live up But I'm falling alright and she's falling alright We're heading for perfect disaster And I'm falling all night and she's falling tonight But wait till the morning I know that I hate her even though I love her She's making my heart hurt I can't describe describe How I hate her every time I'm with her All I do is want her why do I even try I give her all I've got to give But she makes it so hard to live And I do everything I can but she wants She wants she wants she wants a perfect man Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh My love's the simple kind but it's hard to find With anyone else they would get in line But she's all that I can see something's wrong with me 'Cause all that she wants I could never be But I'm falling alright and she's falling alright We're heading for perfect disaster And I'm falling all night and she's falling tonight But wait till the morning I know that I hate her even though I love her She's making my heart hurt I can't describe describe How I hate her every time I'm with her All I do is want her why do I even try I give her all I've got to give But she makes it so hard to live And I'd do everything I can but she wants She wants she wants she wants a perfect man Everything about her every time around her She's in control like it don't matter Just another body swinging for show I'm underrated rehabilitated ready to go But can't she understand that I know I know But I'm falling alright and she's falling alright We're heading for perfect disaster And I'm falling all night and she's falling tonight But wait till the morning I know that I hate her even though I love her She's making my heart hurt I can't describe describe How I hate her every time I'm with her All I do is want her why do I even try I give her all I've got to give But she makes it so hard to live And I'd do everything I can but she wants She wants she wants she wants a perfect man Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh yeah
