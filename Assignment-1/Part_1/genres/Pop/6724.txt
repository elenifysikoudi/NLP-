Yeah Oh yeah woah oh Sittin here just thinkin bout this situation That's why I'm sending you a 2 way now We gotta few things we need to figure out Memories of the night we kissed Now it seems like we don't exist You change your mind about a thousand times Girl I know you're kind But that ain't right Now when we're alone and I'm kissing you There's no place that I'd rather be Baby believe I'm so into you But I'm so confused cause Chorus You say STOP when you really mean GO You tell me YES when you really mean NO If I'm not what you want baby that's alright Just stop giving me the green light Spending hours at a time talking on the phone Telling me that maybe I could be the one Girl you're leading me on and it just ain't right So stop giving me the green light You tell me that I'm trippin and over reacting And boy you need to settle down stop making this bigger than it is right now If I'm wrong well then tell me why If I'm not look me in my eyes Like the way you always change Get around your then forget my name Don't mis understand I'm not saying that I'm ready for this thing to end Make up your mind are we more than friends And I'm out on a limb cause CHORUS Girl you say stop when you mean go You tell me yes when you mean no Giving me the green light Girl you say stop when you mean go You tell me yes when you mean no CHORUS
