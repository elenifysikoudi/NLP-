"As I'm sitting here in the firelight And turning back the years I can hear my mother singing in the morning As she scrubbed our shining faces And then packed us off to school All too soon those days were over without warning Sing me the songs of our gold and silver days Days filled with innocence and light Not a penny to our name We were happy just the same In our gold and silver days In the parlor on a Friday night My father took the floor I can hear us join together in the chorus Singing ""Just a Song at Twilight"" Or ""The Moon Behind the Hill"" Now those voices are all silenced gone before us Sing me the songs of our gold and silver days Days filled with innocence and light Not a penny to our name We were happy just the same In our gold and silver days And we gathered at the Daisy Field On Sunday after mass I can hear the songs the story's and the laughter Through the years we all were scattered But the friends we made back then Were the friends we could rely on ever after So sing me the songs of our gold and silver days Days filled with innocence and light Not a penny to our name We were happy just the same In those gold and silver days"
