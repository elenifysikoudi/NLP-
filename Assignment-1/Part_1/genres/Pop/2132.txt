The sun stole your heart and then left you in the sane world I do realize I'm often vague The shore smells the sweetest when all that is left your pale your dry And I do recognize I'm often vain Eros stole your words and you weren't the same not scared of time and I do recognize there is more than fate the souls never ending and worth the wait It's safe to fly I do recognize this old souls face
