Verse 1 Calm sort of feeling They're all turned to gray The days much colder and there's not much left to say Tried to stop from shaking Want to feel you close You kept your distance when I needed you the most Chorus The sun was bright it never shined I know you're mine But still I cry Verse 2 It makes no difference If you turn away No hope for me now And I'm better off that way Only left a moment That's all it took No sound for me now Foundation shook Burned down the bridges Burned down the town Forget tomorrow no one's around Searched all the ditches And all the sounds That's why tomorrow Won't come around Chorus The sun was bright It never shines I know you're mine But I still I die
