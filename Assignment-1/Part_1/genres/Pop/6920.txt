Goody goodbye bye bye I'll see you never Goody goodbye bye bye So you think you're clever While playing with my heart You over played your part I must have been dumb Dumb as they come To believe you from the start Goody good luck to you and to the other I mean the one you've kept under cover Take a goody good look In the goody Good Book There's a goody good reason why It's goodbye bye bye goody goodbye
