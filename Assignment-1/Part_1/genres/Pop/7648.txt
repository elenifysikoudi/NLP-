I can never be sure Why you make me feel the way I do It's the dangerous excitement I feel whenever I'm with you With you I always feel so good Some people say that you've brought me to life All I know is what I feel inside When I'm with you I'm on a natural high I'm so glad to be with you I want to share in everything you do So glad to be with you I want to share in everything you do Share it with me baby You understand all my needs You're always there for me For you I'd do anything That you would ask of me Together we are a team Side by side I hope that we'll always be Good for each other we both agree That's why I'm so glad to be I want to be by your side Want to be with you tonight You're all I ever wanted Yes you're all I ever wanted baby I want to be by your side Want to be with you tonight You're all I ever wanted Yes you're all I ever wanted baby
