I keep an open invitation To a world of isolation Its an old right I found a home in hibernation Lost the self in preservation Built the walls high I joke about the bad times To get me thru the good times About all those long nights I go wading through Keep running down a one way Giving all for a brand new day But now Im all out nothing to lose Nothing to lose nothing to save From a momentary glory To a solitary story Its a short ride Through the trials and tribulations For the bane of reputation Its a long fight but Im done done I joke about the bad times To get me thru the good times About all those long nights I go wading through Keep running down a one way Giving all for a brand new day But now Im all out nothing to lose Nothing to lose nothing to save No more ties I joke about the bad times To get me thru the good times About all those long nights I go wading through Keep running down a one way Giving all for a brand new day But now Im all out nothing to lose Nothing to lose nothing to save No more ties no more ties
