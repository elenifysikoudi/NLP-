It's almost December it's nearly a year Since we took down our little tree Packed all the baubles and tinsel away And left it out on the street It's almost December it's nearly a year Since you just left me suddenly Packed up a suitcase while I was asleep And quietly crept out on me I still find Blue spruce needles under the couch when I clean It reminds Me that people fall out of love as easily as in I still find Blue spruce needles whenever I sweep out my heart If Christmas is about being together Then how can it be Christmas if we are apart It's almost December it's nearly a year Since we took down our little tree I wish I didn't still think about it But I don't forget easily I still find Blue spruce needles under the couch when I clean It reminds Me that people fall out of love as easily as in I still find Blue spruce needles whenever I sweep out my heart If Christmas is about being together Then how can it be Christmas if we are apart Oh if Christmas is about being together Then how can it be Christmas if we are apart I still find Blue spruce needles under the couch when I clean It reminds Me that people fall out of love as easily as in I still find Blue spruce needles whenever I sweep out my heart If Christmas is about being together Then how can it be Christmas if we are apart
