Comin up Comin up Comin up Comin up Comin up Imagine we're some place far away far away No one around we're alone we're alone Just us and the music we can run away run away Hold on tight don't let go 'Cause every time we move Our love is in the spotlight Nothin left to do Walk away the moonlight 'Long as I'm with you I never have to dance alone again Just take my hand and Let the beat control you Let your mind escape Feel the rhythm move you Till the light of day We can feel the sun we can feel the sun We can feel the sun comin up comin up We can feel the sun we can feel the sun We can feel the sun comin up comin up We can feel the sun Feel the world right in front of us in front of us You and I with the stars stars Slowly gone there's no need to rush no need to rush Universe will be ours 'Cause every time we move Our love is in the spotlight Nothin left to do Walk away the moonlight 'Long as I'm with you I never have to dance alone again Just take my hand and Let the beat control you Let your mind escape Feel the rhythm move you Till the light of day We can feel the sun we can feel the sun We can feel the sun we can feel the sun We can feel the sun comin up comin up We can feel the sun we can feel the sun We can feel the sun comin up comin up We can feel the sun we can feel the sun We can feel the sun we can feel the sun We can feel the sun comin up comin up We can feel the sun we can feel the sun We can feel the sun comin up comin up We can feel the sun we can feel the sun We can feel the sun
