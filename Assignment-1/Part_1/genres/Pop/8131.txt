Vs 1 Drowning in the memories of your past mistakes Your hoping that the pain will just go away Trying hard to solve it all on your own But you can't overcome this battle all alone Chorus But he will carry you When you can't stand All you gotta do Is put it in his hands His mercy will endure But you can be sure No matter what your going through He will carry you He will carry you Vs 2 Right now you feel like there's just no way out You're confused and your minds filled with so much doubt You failed so many times you have no strength to go But in your moment of despair theres one thing you should know Chorus Bridge He will carry you La la la la la la la Through the wind and through rain Through the sorrow and the pain When you feel your strength is gone and you can't go on Repeat Chorus
