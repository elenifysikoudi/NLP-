Sleeping in on Saturdays Can't get off the couch yeah Bong sits on the table still From last night's run around Said it's all in the fable Are we supposed to go down yeah You may feel unstable But you're still on the ground Oh oh oh oh oh oh Marvin gets my matinee Gonna order something in New high score on this video game Another beer and I'll be king Said it's all in the fable Are we supposed to go down yeah You may feel unstable But you're still on the ground Oh oh oh oh oh oh
