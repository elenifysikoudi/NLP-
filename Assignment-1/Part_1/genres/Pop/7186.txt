As the rain pours down Washes out my thoughts of you And the hurling sound It's wallows up your name Iconoclast the hidden past you left before you came You charmed my darkest hour It's close again and things are not the same I remember you you're the one who came Crawling from the past like a falling flame Did you hold it down or give yourself away Did you hold it back or open up the gates To call a flood to sweep it up Or drown it in the rain I remember you you're the one who came Falling from the past like a falling flame I never chose to be this way to be alone There never was another choice there never was As the rain pours down Washes out my thoughts of you And the hurling sound It's wallows up your name I remember you you're the one who came Falling from the past like a falling flame I remember you i remember you Like a falling flame like a falling flame I remember you I remember you
