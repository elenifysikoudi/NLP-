Hope sleeps without me Her sweet dreams surround me But I'm left out I'll need a fix now To believe to feel These rooms are dark now These halls are hollow And so am I She is hard to find now To believe To see Hope is what we crave and that will never change So I stand and wait I need a drop of grace to carry me today A simple song to say It's written on my soul Hope's what we crave I won't turn to dust now Let these tears rust now on my face Give me the spark now To believe To see Hope is what we crave and that will never change So I stand and wait I need a drop of grace to carry me today A simple song to say It's written on my soul Hope's what we crave To live to die To lose to get To rise above To love again To live to die To lose to get To rise above To love again To love again Hope is what we crave and that will never change So I stand and wait I need a drop of grace to carry me today A simple song to say Hope is what we crave I need a drop of grace It's written on my soul Hope's what we crave It's written on my soul Hope's what we crave Mmmmmmmm Hope's what we crave MMmmmmmm Hope's what I crave
