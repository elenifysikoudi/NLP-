Your hand your heart and your love On these three things I've built my dreams I've built my dreams Your hand your heart and your love That's all I long Long to possess No more no less If I had forever What nothing else to do There still wouldn't be Enough time for me to Show my love for you In your arms on your lips Heaven lies But there is no pride I place so much Your hand your heart and your love
