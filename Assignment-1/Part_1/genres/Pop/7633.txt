I always thought that I knew it all but I knew nothing I couldn't see I was destined to fall now it's too late Took you for granted I always thought you'd be there I didn't notice when your presence became scarce Took you for granted I always thought you'd be there I didn't notice when your presence became scarce I always thought I knew it all the truth was I knew nothing Couldn't see I was destined to fall before it was too late no I always thought I knew it all the truth was I knew nothing Couldn't see I was destined to fall before it was too late no I paid the price cause now you're gone from my life and I have nothing So caught in myself cared for no one else now you've slipped away I always thought I knew it all the truth was I had nothing Couldn't see I was destined to fall but now it's too late Wanted a second chance but you won't take me back I'm full of regrets if you asked me back baby I'd say yes
