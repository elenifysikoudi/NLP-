I see it everyday We say it's only living Like life is only pain I see heartbreak on every face Hurt we can't erase Dreams that fade away Like we're all just lost at sea We need we need an answer a hope And an end to the searching We need we need a portrait of grace Just one steady thing In a world that aches In a world that breaks Somehow before life began You saw broken man But You had a perfect plan You would send your only Son The Holy gift of love And He would be enough To erase all the pain of man You are You are the answer the hope And the end to the searching You are You are the portrait of grace You're the one steady thing In a world that aches In a world that breaks You are You are the answer You are You are the answer You are You are the answer Jesus You are And you are You are the answer the hope And the end to the searching You are You are the portrait of grace You're the one steady thing You are You are the answer the hope And the end to the searching You are You are the portrait of grace You're the one steady thing In a world that aches In a world that breaks In a world that aches In a world that breaks
