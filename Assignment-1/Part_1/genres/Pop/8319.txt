I want to hold you baby I want to hold you Never be lonely with me by your side Say that you want me baby I got the things you've needed to get by I wish you'd love me too This time you promise look into my eyes Can give you lovin baby Show me the way to make you feel all right Falling in love to you I want to be your number one Nobody else tonight You're gonna be my crazy love I'll never let you down Don't want to lose you I knew you'll never gonna break my heart Say that you want me baby I got the things you've needed to get by Falling in love again
