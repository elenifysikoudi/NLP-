Hot and sexy is the definition of her So why she workin with someone who doesn't value her worth Don't want to be the one To come between cause that's not my style If it don't happen now it's just a matter of time Till she realizes what she needs Let go and just release herself from love not working Till she realizes what she needs Let go and just release herself from love thats hurting What'cha got to lose Not trying to me rude just telling it like I see What do I got to do To pull you away and get you alone with me Dont waste your time with a man who just don't understand What'cha got to lose Break these chains and walk away with me yeah What'cha got to lose What'cha what'cha what'cha got to lose What'cha got to lose yeah yeah What'cha got to lose What'cha what'cha what'cha got to lose to lose Allow this introduction girl the pleasure is mine Contradicting myself now push your man to the side Don't want to be the one to come between Somethings gotta give Take my hand that's the plan I'm taking you from yo man Till she realizes what she needs Let go and just release herself from love not working Till she realizes what she needs Let go and just release herself from love thats hurting What'cha got to lose What'cha got to lose my baby What'cha got to lose What'cha got to lose my baby What'cha got What'cha got to lose She got a sexiness Overflowing finesse It is evident that she's my queen One good look in has eyes has got me mesmerized I want to give her everything that she needs Till she realizes what she needs Let go and just release herself from love not working Till she realizes what she needs Let go and just release herself from love thats hurting Till she realizes what she needs Let go and then released herself from love not working Till she realizes what she needs Let go and then released herself from love thats hurting
