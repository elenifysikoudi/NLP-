Chicks and geese and ducks better scurry When I take you out in the surrey When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top Watch the fringe and see how it flutters I will ride those high steppin strutters Noswey pokes will peek through their shutters And their eyes will pop The wheels are yeller the upholsters brown The dash board's genuine leather With in sin glass curtains you can roll right down In case there's a change in the weather Two bright side lights winkin and blinkin' Ain't no fingering what I'm thinkin' You'd be fingering if your thinkin that I'd care to swap For the shiny little surrey with the fringe on top
