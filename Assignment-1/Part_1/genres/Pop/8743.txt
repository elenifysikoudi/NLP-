Girl you could explain for a thousand days But I'll never work out why we're throwing it all away You say you're still in love you just need more space I don't have the strength to leave you but I don't wanna wait I'm not trying to bring you down I'm only calling you because I thought you should know I can't get used to life without you Close my eyes see your face And nothing seems to ease the pain And I just can't get through these nights without you Close my eyes see your face I only have myself to blame Girl lying alone I feel out of place It's all that I can do to get up and turn the page Every spin of the hands is a thousand days The things I left unsaid pushed you so far away I'm not trying to bring you down I'm only calling you because I thought you should know I can't wait there's no more time I'm getting lost inside my mind And it's easy to see that I Let you slip right through my hands I can't believe that it's over I wanna open my eyes and see you here Can't get used to life without you Close my eyes see your face I'll only have myself to blame Can't get used to life without you Close my eyes see your face And nothing seems to ease the pain And I just can't get through these nights without you Close my eyes see your face I only have myself to blame You're all I need to survive You're all I need to get by You're all I need to survive You're all I need to get by
