"I hear your name and fall to desire Here is a light and a hope on fire I wonder how I could leave this again But here in the night and beside all your light I wonder how How I For twenty four years I have drowned in my tears And still can't find my way I wear this name and I feel it's my disguise Here was a light and a hope on fire For twenty four years I have drowned in my tears And still can't find my way Never go We can never say never You can't breathe ""we will always stay together"" I say am fine Behind four walls Oh but in this world I am not fine at all For twenty four years I have drowned in my fears I still can't find my way "
