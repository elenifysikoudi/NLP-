I got that instinct about you I got that instinct when I'm around you I got that instinct about you I got that instinct when I think of you I don't usually hang around In places I am easily found It's not my style to act like this I played it safe won't take the risk Move closer I could feel you I know what I have to do I don't want to do this But you have got me hanging around for you I don't know where this is leading But I can't deny this feeling inside Oh it feels so right I got that instinct about you I got that instinct when I'm around you I got that instinct about you I got that instinct when I think of you I guess I've broken every rule I shouldn't be hanging out approaching you I can't seem to hold this back I know I shouldn't let this moment pass When I saw ya like the way I do That no one else would do do I don't want to do this But you have got me hanging around for you I don't know where this is leading But I can't deny this feeling inside Oh it feels so right I got that instinct about you I got that instinct when I'm around you I got that instinct about you I got that instinct when I think of you I got these feelings about you I hope that you really feel me too I got these feelings about you I hope that you really feel me too Just say that you want me I got that instinct about you I got that instinct when I'm around you I got that instinct about you I got that instinct when I think of you
