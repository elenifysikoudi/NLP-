"Something told me It was over When I saw you And her talking Something deep Down In my soul said ""Cry Girl"" When I saw you And that girl Walking around woo I would rather I would rather Go blind boy Than to see you Walk away From me child Woo Woo So you see I love you So much That I don't want To watch you Leave me baby Most of all I just don't I just don't want To be free no no woo I was just I was just I was just Sitting here Thinking Of your kiss And your Warm embrace Yeah When A reflection In the glass That I held To my lips now Baby Revealed The tears That are On my face And baby baby I would rather Be blind boy Than to see you Walk away See you Walk away From me yeah Baby baby baby I'd rather be Blind"
