Feelings of my pain Sitting on this train This lonely night Feelings I've got you under my skin I really want you on my skin This lonely night The night that I'm so sad So blue so very far from you And everytime i know How many times you've gone Sometimes I feel Like a woman in love Sometimes I feel Like a woman in chains But everytime I forget all my fears When I see your face Inside my tears Feelings Feelings of my pain Sitting on this train This lonely night Feelings I've got you under my skin I really want you on my skin This lonely night The night that I'm so sad So blue so very far from you And everytime I know How many times you've gone But everytime I forget all my fears When I see your face Inside my tears inside my tears
