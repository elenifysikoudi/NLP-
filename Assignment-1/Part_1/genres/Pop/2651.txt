We are born alone and lonely we remain When we learn to speak we speak to hear a voice As the years go by we learn a thousand words Then we try to talk to curse the silent sky Like diamonds in the ground We are waiting to be found In silence we are bound By the wailing wall of sound Like diamonds in the ground We are waiting to be found In silence we are bound By the wailing wall of sound Want to break the shell and cut the puppet strings With our primal screams that echoes back inside Want to pierce the noise and make our voices heard To the distant shapes that wonders who we are Like diamonds in the ground We are waiting to be found In silence we are bound By the wailing wall of sound Like diamonds in the ground We are waiting to be found In silence we are bound By the wailing wall of sound We must put aside the weapons of our minds Cross the no man's land come with empty hands Overcome the fear to drop the last defence Speak forbidden words reach out beyond ourselves Like diamonds in the ground We are waiting to be found In silence we are bound By the wailing wall of sound Like diamonds in the ground We are waiting to be found In silence we are bound By the wailing wall of sound Like diamonds in the ground We are waiting to be found In silence we are bound By the wailing wall of sound
