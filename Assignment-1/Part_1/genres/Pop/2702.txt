we close our eyes and look in opposite direction we ignore the threats and hope they'll go away we refuse to pay attention to the dangers we create in the name of our fathers we kill our children we wait and think that we are biding our time we keep silent we believe in our strength we trust in propaganda of the wonders of tomorrow in the shadow of content we are victims in the end we dance to the sound of sirens and we watch genocide to relax we dance to the sound of sirens we are the heroes of self deception we are nailed to the ground frozen in our movements we listen while the sirens sound speaking of improvements we have anger in our souls that waits to be released in the chill of fear we're petrified and useless when it counts we dance to the sound of sirens and we watch genocide to relax we dance to the sound of sirens we are the heroes of self deception
