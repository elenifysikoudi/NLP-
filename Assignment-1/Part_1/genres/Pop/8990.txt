Oh look at the view Look at the people running They've so much to do Better than you Better than take what's coming Nothing's ever new And everything that looks so good from here Living out a dream I've had for a year Living out a dream I've had Oh the avenue They're taking the trees down And they're asking me and you What can we do We can stand in a circle Paying tribute with paper and glue And everything that looks so good from here Living out a dream I've had for a year Living out a dream I've had I was sure I'd move to heaven But the feeling didn't last We've never been forgiven For the things done in the past I often stand and stare at you Protected by the glass But I have nothing more to say to you So please don't ever ask Oh hidden from view The place that we keep from How I miss those elegant lines And the sun on the blinds They beckon me down here From what I know now are sunnier climbs And everything that looks so good from here Living out a dream I've had for a year Living out a dream I've had I was sure I'd move to heaven But the feeling didn't last We've never been forgiven For the things done in the past I often stand and stare at you Protected by the glass But I have nothing more to say to you So please don't ever ask I never knew that I had been here before They're running through houses And breaking down doors No matter where you go They'll follow you follow you follow you I was sure I'd move to heaven But the feeling didn't last We've never been forgiven For the things done in the past I often stand and stare at you Protected by the glass But I have nothing more to say to you So please don't ever ask
