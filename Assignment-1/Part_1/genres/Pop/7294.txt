There it is I think we got the perfect shot You'd never know at dinner we didn't even talk And we look so amazing who wouldn't want to be us But the smile that we're faking fades when the cameras off And we hold it just for the moment And what we let the whole world see Isn't really you and me So tell me whats a picture worth If we can't say a single word We always put a filter on just try to cover up the flaws And if we do it all for show I think it's time we let it go Cause I can picture us picture us I can picture us with no filter Cause I can picture us picture us I can picture us with no filter on Remember when we didn't have to live a lie And now we can't even look each other in the eye Yeah I like to believe we could go back to the start And if we turn it off we'll just see me in dark Can you hold me just for a moment And what we let the whole world see isn't really you and me So tell me whats a picture worth If we can't say a single word We always put a filter on filter on just trying to cover up the flaws And if we do it all for show I think its time we let it go time we let it go Cause I can picture us picture us I can picture us with no filter I can picture us picture us I can picture us with no filter on And we look so amazing who wouldn't want to be us But the smile that I'm faking fades when the cameras off And we hold it just for the moment And what we let the whole world see isn't really you and me So tell me whats a picture worth a picture worth If we can't say a single word We always put a filter on just trying to cover up the flaws And if we do it all for show all for show I think its time we let it go its time we let it go Cause I can picture us picture us I can picture us with no filter I can picture us picture us I can picture us with no filter on With no filter on
