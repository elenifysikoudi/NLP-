Baby Baby I've been waiting For somebody to love just me I'm so happy now that I found you I'll stand by you till eternity Don't ever leave me don't ever let me go I wouldn't know what to do I wouldn't know where to go Don't ever leave me I'm giving you my heart And it would break in two if we should ever part Baby tell me how much you love me And I have something to say to you I will always make you happy And I promise that I will be true Don't ever leave me don't ever let me go I wouldn't know what to do I wouldn't know where to go Don't ever leave me I'm giving you my heart And it would break in two if we should ever part Don't ever leave me don't ever let me go I wouldn't know what to do I wouldn't know where to go Don't ever leave me I'm giving you my heart And it would break in two if we should ever part Baby Baby don't ever leave me Don't ever leave me
