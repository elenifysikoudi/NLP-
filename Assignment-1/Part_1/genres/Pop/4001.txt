I climbed a mountain Not knowing that I had Thought it was just a road from A to B I took no protection Not much of anything Just went as I was Looking in windows And playing songs and knocking on doors I was not scared I just enjoyed the sights Kept myself to myself There I was sitting on the roof of the world There I was there I was Not knowing how I got there Or how to leave Everyone says I was lucky to have got there As not many can Truth be told I was saved By the love of a good man Who came and got me And brought me down From on up there And I'd be lying if I didn't say I missed it now and then But I have no wish to go back there There I was Sitting on the roof of the world There I was with all the Gods Not knowing how I got there or how to leave People say What's so special about being back here With everyone so close But that's the point I don't want to be different I just want to fit in There I was there I was Sitting on the roof of the world There I was with all the Gods Not knowing how I got there Or how to leave Not knowing how I got there Or how to leave Not knowing how I got there Or how to leave
