Ryan I sit here thinking As the sun is sinking Over the mountain And the dry dusty ground Damian As the night is falling I start recalling The nights In my own town Keith I see the faces In familiar places I hear the music That they played way back then Paul My heart rejoices As I hear the voices Calling me Home again Chorus All Home Oh take me home Oh to the people I left behind Oh to the love I know I'll find Oooh take me home George As the sky is burning My mind is turning To the cold winter evenings By my own fire side All So far away now But any day now I'll sail On the morning tide Chorus All Home Oh take me home Oh to the people I left behind Oh to the love I know I'll find Oooh take me home Keith Take me home Far across the sea All Home is where I long to be Chorus All Home Da da da da Oh take me home Da da da da Oh to the people Da da da da da I left behind Da da da Oh to the love Da da da da I know I'll find Da da da da Oooh take me home
