All God's creatures got a place in the choir Some sing low and some sing higher Some sing out loud on a telephone wire Some just clap their hands or paws or anything they've got now All God's creatures got a place in the choir Some sing low and some sing higher Some sing out loud on a telephone wire Some just clap their hands or paws or anything they've got now Listen to the top where the little bird sings On the melodies and the high notes ringing And the hoot owl cries over everything And the blackbird disagrees Singing in the night time singing in the day When little duck quacks and he's on his way And the otter hasn't got much to say And the porcupine talks to himself All God's creatures got a place in the choir Some sing low and some sing higher Some sing out loud on a telephone wire Some just clap their hands or paws or anything they've got now The dogs and the cats they take up the middle While the honeybee hums and the cricket fiddles The donkey brays and the pony neighs And the old gray badger sighs Listen to the bass it's the one on the bottom Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus Moans and groans with a big t'do And the old cow just goes moo All God's creatures got a place in the choir Some sing low and some sing higher Some sing out loud on a telephone wire Some just clap their hands or paws or anything they've got now It's a simple song a little song everywhere By the ox and the fox and the grizzly bear The dopey alligator and the the hawk above The sly old weasel and the turtle dove All God's creatures got a place in the choir Some sing low and some sing higher Some sing out loud on a telephone wire Some just clap their hands or paws or anything they've got now All God's creatures got a place in the choir Some sing low and some sing higher Some sing out loud on a telephone wire Some just clap their hands or paws or anything they've got now All God's creatures got a place in the choir Some sing low and some sing higher Some sing out loud on a telephone wire Some just clap their hands or paws or anything they've got now All God's creatures got a place in the choir
