I was walking out the door on a Friday I just couldn't make up my mind And just when I pulled out of the driveway I saw you as you rode right by You had the bright blue eyes in the red hot sun You smiled right back and the party begun Will blast the gun get the noose having fun And we ain't goin nowhere When the night is almost over but everyone is jammin away You know it's gonna be a long week end 'Cause the drinks are gettin colder But we're still gettin older and say You know it's gonna be a long week end We watched the sunrise in the mornin' Shinin bright in the 3 05 Now you're swimming outside in the ocean All there yeah you're by my side You had the light brown hair in the red hot sun When you smile right back where the party is from Will blast the gun get the noose having fun And we ain't goin nowhere When the night is almost over but everyone is jammin away You know it's gonna be a long week end 'Cause the drinks are gettin colder But we're still gettin older and say You know it's gonna be a long week end If I ever make all the way back home I know you and I will newer be alone We'll go dancing in the moon all night long And nobody going anywhere When the night is almost over but everyone is jammin away You know it's gonna be a long week end 'Cause the drinks are gettin colder But we're still gettin older and say You know it's gonna be a long week end You know it's gonna be a long week end You know it's gonna be a long week end You know it's gonna be a long week end You know it's gonna be a long week end
