The night I woke in laughter the pain came surely after tried to rise above the sinking feeling then the rain fell through my ceiling the lives I lead are not a strangers and the quiet I need protects me from danger I have relied on some strangers notion close my eyes I am thinking emotion all I have ever wanted isn't so strangely out of sync with where I am now and if the truth remains in verses I know the worst is over now over land and sea in the motion I have survived more on heat than immersion I have relied on some divine notion close my eyes think I am sick from the motion all I have ever wanted isnt so strangely out of sync with where I am now and if the truth remains in verses I know the verse is over now and with a stronger tie than worship I know you are there following me through all the verses I write and if my truth remains in front of me I know you are there I know the worst is over now
