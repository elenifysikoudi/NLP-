Standing all alone in the dark And there's no one round Who could break my heart In those lonely nights I saw you But still there is no one round To make this dream come true I can't feel you When I touch you I can't see you When I love you I can't hold you When I'm with you But I feel that you're near In dreams I see your face I miss Your warm embrace Your tender lovin care That we used to share Where did you go I need you so In dreams You're in my arms I miss Your warmin charms The magic in your eyes The starlight in the skies Will shine Only for me Can't you see the tears in my eyes When I tried to touch you Babe I couldn't hold you tight Put your hand in mine And come true 'Cause the love we shared tonight I want to live with you I can't feel you In dreams I see your face In dreams You're in my arms In dreams I see your face
