Everybody's staring at my Everybody's out to catch my eye I've gotta think it over I've gotta think it over Everybody's got somebody to All I wanted was a body to hide I've gotta think it over I've gotta think it over I'm not a saint I'm not a saint I'm not a saint I'm not a saint Dog is barking head is hurting Car is chasing hands are dirty I've gotta think it over I've gotta think it over I'm not a saint I'm not a saint It's the way I feel inside I'm not a saint I'm not a saint Takes me over sometimes
