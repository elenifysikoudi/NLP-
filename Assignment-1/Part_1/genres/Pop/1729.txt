Black is the color of my true love`s hair Her lips are like some roses fair She`s got the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands I love the ground whereon she stands I love my love and well she knows I love the ground whereon she goes But I wish the day soon will come When she and I could be as one Black is the color of my true love`s hair Her lips are like some roses fair She`s got the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands I love the ground whereon she stands I go to the Clyde and I mourn and weep But satisfied I never can sleep I'll write her a letter just a few short lines And suffer death a thousand times
