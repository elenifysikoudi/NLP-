The world is growing loud It's time for us to fade away I wish that I could say The lights are going out We knew they had to go one day I wish to take this in The skies are falling down Too late for us to change out minds I wish to keep us safe The times are changing fast We knew they wouldn't last this long I had to keep the pace
