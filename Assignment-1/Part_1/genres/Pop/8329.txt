Love me want me hold me tight just like the dreams I dreamt last night Show me all that you feel inside Your heart your body right next to mine I know you've waited for so long my love is real and twice as strong I'll give you love you've never known Don't tear my heart don't let me go There is nobody else but you I give you all my love that's true Feel my love it's so deep inside without your touch I can't survive Chorus I've never needed no one like I need you it's true that it's over but I'll always run back to you I never needed no one like I need you but I'll always run back to you Your love is not what it seems so never take away my dreams Don't leave me out here all alone time and time again I've shown If you feel sad I won't dare because I know you never cared Gave you things be on your way our love is gone so we can't stay I know you feel bad down inside your inner weakness please don't hide All the times that we did share girl don't look back cause Under your spell baby I won't let you go So I'm coming back and I'm letting you know that Chorus back to you ohh I'm under your spell baby I won't let you go So I'm coming back and I'm letting you know that Chorus back to you ohh chorus fades out
