You were walking on the moon Now you feeling low ow ow What they said wasn't true You're beautiful Sticks and stones break your bones I know what you're feeling Words like those Won't steal your glow You're one in a million this this is for all the girls Boys all over the world Whatever you been told You're worth more than gold So hold your head up high It's your time to shine From the inside out it shows You're worth more than gold You're worth more than gold Everybody keeps score Afraid you're gonna loo loo loo loose Just ignore They don't know the real you All the rain in the sky Cant put out your fire Of all the stars out tonight You shine brighter this this is for all the girls Boys all over the world Whatever you been told You're worth more than gold So hold your head up high It's your time to shine From the inside out it shows You're worth more than gold You're worth more than gold So don't let anybody tell you that you're not loved And don't let anybody tell you that you're not enough Yeah there are days when we all feel like we're messed up But that truth is that we're all diamonds in the rough So don't be ashamed to wear you're crown You're a king you're a queen inside and out You glow like the moon you shine like the sun This goes to you wherever you are This this is for all the girls Boys all over the world Whatever you been told You're worth more than gold So hold your head up high It's your time to shine From the inside out it shows You're worth more than gold You're worth more than gold So don't be ashamed to wear you're crown You're a king you're a queen inside and out
