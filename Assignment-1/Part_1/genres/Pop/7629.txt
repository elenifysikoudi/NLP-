As I look back in time It's clear for me to see That I was meant for you And you were meant for me Since the day we met Had only eyes to see one another No one else could compete Looking back I remember All the fun and games And what we've got right now Really hasn't changed 'Cause we always believed Believed in what we had So we did did our best to make it last 'Cause I have a love for you unbreakable I have a love for you so strong I have a love that's oh so deep 'Cause I've loved you all along 'Cause I have a love for you unbreakable I have a love for you so strong I have a love that's oh so deep 'Cause I've loved you all along Well have you ever wondered how we ever came to be Have you ever wondered why there's still a you and me Have you ever wondered why I haven't turned and walked away And why I stayed So have you ever wondered how we ever came to be Have you ever wondered why there's still a you and me Have you ever wondered why I haven't turned and walked away And why I stayed Many times I've wondered How we've kept our love alive 'Cause we've come through some things That others don't survive But we've always believed Believed in what we had So we did did our best to make it last So have you ever wondered how we came to be Have you ever wondered why there's still a you and me Have you ever wondered why I haven't turned and walked away And why I stayed So have you ever wondered how we ever came to be Have you ever wondered why there's still a you and me Have you ever wondered why I haven't turned and walked away And why I stayed So have you ever wondered how we came to be Have you ever wondered why there's still a you and me Have you ever wondered why I haven't turned and walked away And why I stayed So have you ever wondered how we ever came to be Have you ever wondered why there's still a you and me Have you ever wondered why I haven't turned and walked away And why I stayed
