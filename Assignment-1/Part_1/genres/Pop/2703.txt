give me give me the speed I need i want more life don't need this state to last I want more to burn I want more to break so give me the speed I need my own movements feel so strange are we all insane ir is it only me believing believing in the free will to last to burn to die fail against my domination learn the sweetness of my mercy guide my reckless steel let go let go unknown mind motions actions from a pure mind a rare thing a wise thing so begin move crush so restless dayless always fail against my domination learn the sweetness of my mercy guide my reckless steel make me feel or fix my speed
