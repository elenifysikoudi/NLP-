Staring at the crowd when you caught my eye Time slowly ticking as I keep on standing by Baby If I eyes we can already know I'm already thinking of another place to go There's a lot of people in a trance tonight Playing all the games trying to make you mine Getting even closer to the finish line Looking over here I can give you a sign Yeah I'm going to take you to another place Yeah Yeah Yeah so you and I can meet face to face Yeah Yeah There won't be no problems You me and the comets Nobody will find us Yeah Yeah Yeah so you and I can meet face to face People see you staring thinking falling in love There always watching and eyes just can't get enough
