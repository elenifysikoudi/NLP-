So you say he let you on you'll never give your heart Your heart is feeling hurt and confused You say you did the givin more than gettin' All he did was take and left you feelin so used I won't love and leave your heart filled with doubt I'm for real that's not what I'm all about I'll love you down down to the last drop and down Baby I won't stop and when you've had enough I'll just stop and start over again What kind of fool would steal your love like that He wasn't what he seemed he schemed and lied From the start But baby don't you chalk it up you've gotta give it one More chance These words come straight from my heart I'll erase the hurt deep inside You'll forget the tears you've cried I'll love you down down to the last drop and down Baby I won't stop and when you've had enough I'll just stop and start over again I'll be everything you need and more I'll give you all the love you missed before Trust in me Time to put the past behind you Just look up and love will find you Look and see I won't love and leave your heart filled with doubt Girl I'm for real that's not what I'm all about I'll love you down down to the last drop and down Baby I won't stop and when you've had enough I'll just stop and start over again Yes I will baby I'll love you down down to the last drop and down Baby I won't stop and when you've had enough I'll just stop and start over again I'll love you down down to the last drop and down Baby I won't stop and when you've had enough I'll just stop and start over again
