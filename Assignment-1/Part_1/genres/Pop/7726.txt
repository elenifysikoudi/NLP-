Wanna tell you I'm alright Wanna say I'm not in pain But I would just be telling lies I'm not okay I'm not okay Wanna travel back in time Say the things I didn't say I wanna tell you everything If it's not too late Is it too late Will you be there if I call Will you leave me in the rain If I say it's all my fault Will you still walk away I understand if you're afraid But people change People change Stay awake and talk to me Let me hold you while you sleep I've been out here on my own But you're my home You're my home Will you be there if I call Will you leave me in the rain If I say it's all my fault Will you still walk away I understand if you're afraid But people change People change I'm not gonna let you down this time Darling don't be afraid People change And I can change Will you be there if I call Will you leave me in the rain If I say it's all my fault Will you still walk away I understand if you're afraid But people change People change People change People change
