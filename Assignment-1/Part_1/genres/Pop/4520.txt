If I had wings I could fly Like a sweet song that makes you cry Like a river to the sea I hear you calling out to me No one else touches me With a whisper a melody When you hold me through the night And you tell me it's gonna be alright I belong to you you belong to me Naturally so naturally Baby I belong to you you belong to me Naturally so naturally I was lost without a friend And you saved me from myself again And there's no one gonna take away The joy you gave me everyday That's no lie you're the reason why You belong to me You belong to me You know there'll never be another Let me be your lover for eternity Baby can't you see we are good together No one's gonna break us apart No one's gonna break us apart You know I gave you my heart boy
