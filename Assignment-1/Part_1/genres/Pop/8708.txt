Shes like a vision when shes standing in the doorway Dont want to give in when she clouds my mind There aint no chance in how she lets you have it your way Cant find the reason why I shouldnt try Oh my watch what shes got and shes breaking me a long time If I like it or not And I really get to comply Watch as it causes me pain All this torture has got me say Please dont stop I I want a taste of what you got I I want to know what gets you hot So baby please dont stop Please dont stop I I want a taste of what you got I I want to know what gets you hot So baby please dont stop Dont stop Please dont stop Please dont stop Dont stop Shes making circles marking her territory Shes staring at me like a bird of prey I know seduction when shes standing before me And I aint telling her to go away Oh my watch what shes got and shes breaking me a long time If I like it or not And I really get to comply Watch as it causes me pain All this torture has got me say Please dont stop I I want a taste of what you got I I want to know what gets you hot So baby please dont stop Please dont stop I I want a taste of what you got I I want to know what gets you hot So baby please dont stop Dont stop Please dont stop I love her I love her I love her I love her so Oh my god im falling for her Is this love or is this torture Oh my god im falling for her Is this love or is this torture Oh my god im falling for her Is this love or is this torture Oh my god im falling for her Is this love or is this torture Is this love Is this love Please dont stop I want a taste of what you got I I want to know what gets you hot So baby please dont stop Please dont stop I I want a taste of what you got I I want to know what gets you hot So baby please dont stop Dont stop Please dont stop Please dont stop Please dont stop Please dont stop
