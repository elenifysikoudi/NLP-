It's time to be honest with myself I've fooled around too long Now all I think about is you And what we used to have I'm scared to live without your love 'Coz you were really all I had Now my only love has gone away And it hurts so bad The only thing that's missing in my life is you The only thing I need in my life is you Is you is you Is you baby It's time to be honest with you babe You made me a better woman You cared for me so much So much you scared me boy Now I feel you in the air I breath Even though you're not in front of me You were like a summer breeze And it's killing me The only thing that's missing in my life is you The only thing I need in my life is you The only thing that's missing in my life is you The only thing I need in my life is you Is you babe You're the only man I'm tired of crying come back in my life Think about it it's been awhile I've never meant to hurt you baby You're the only man I need The only thing that's missing in my life is you The only thing I need in my life is you The only thing that's missing in my life is you The only thing I need in my life is you Is you The only man is you The only man is you The only thing that's missing in my life is you The only thing I need in my life is you The only man is you
