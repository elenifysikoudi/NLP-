The candlelight is fading as I gently kneel and say An Ave for my mother as her spirit slips away Away to join my father and to share eternity We call them kindred spirits now they will forever be So now they're reunited smiling down from up above As fondly we remember the old house they filled with love How even through the hard times they were close as close could be Just like the kindred spirits they will forever be Now love was as deep as the ocean Flying higher than the eagles would dare As strong as the mountains in Donegal As soft as a morning in Clair I can see her in the kitchen I can smell the baking bread I can hear my father singing as he tucked us into bed They shared the love together they were proud as proud could be And now those kindred spirits will share eternity
