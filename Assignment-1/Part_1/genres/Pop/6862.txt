I'll be drowning my sorrows over you I was happy when you were my true love Now I find that I'm losing my mind Cause they told me that you found a new love Now I know that the fates are unkind That's why I'm drowning my sorrows Facing lonely tomorrows Drowning my sorrows In an ocean of tears My broken heart keeps recalling As my teardrops keep falling That I'm drowning my sorrows over you Now I know that my bridges are burning Cause there'll never be no one else for me So I pray darling soon you'll be returning And you'll break these chains of love And set me free Till then I'm drowning my sorrows Facing lonely tomorrows Drowning my sorrows In an ocean of tears My broken heart keeps recalling As my teardrops keep falling That I'm drowning my sorrows over you Yes I'm drowning my sorrows over you
