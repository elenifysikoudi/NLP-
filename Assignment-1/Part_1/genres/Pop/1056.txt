Fur soft as fur Taking the rough with the smooth I know it hurts Me more than it ever would you Fur soft as fur Fresh strawberries and cream Sometimes at work I feel like a machine Dreams don't always come true The way you want them to I suppose this'll have to do For the time being Fishes and worms Frozen under the ice Sometimes it hurts So much it feels nice I'm afraid of growing old And being on my own So I'm putting my country shoulder To the wheel I'm afraid of letting go Of everything I know So I just sadly float Away down stream Smiling at the leaves Chewing butter beans And wondering what dreams Are made of fur Fur fur soft as fur Fur so soft it hurts Fur too soft for words Fur soft as fur
