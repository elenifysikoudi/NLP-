Love is on a side of the highway With its thumb in the sky War is flying in the fast lane In a suit and tie The sun is crashing in the ocean And it just can't help yourself but wonder how we all forget It's a fine fine life It's a fine fine life Every day I find It's a fine fine life I fell asleep in a casino You should've seen her face Feels like I'm stuck in a movie That was never made Jesus stranded with a flat tire And He's grinning ear to ear and whispering these words under His breath It's a fine fine life It's a fine fine life Every day I find It's a fine fine life It's a fine fine life It's a fine fine life Yeah I put a step in your bones You're never alone Cash or coal Heart or soul It's a fine fine life It's a fine fine life Every day I find It's a fine fine life It's a fine fine life It's a fine fine life Every day I find It's a fine fine life It's a fine fine life It's a fine fine life It's a fine fine life Fine fine life It's your life
