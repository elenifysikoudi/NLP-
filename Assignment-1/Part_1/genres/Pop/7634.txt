We should know by now that life is not the same I have watched you try to cover your mistakes I don't care about what the people say But it's down to me I know my mind And I will find my way And I don't regret the time we spent My time with you it was not in vain And I wonder why Where it all went wrong And how you lost your home You're the reason that I'm gone And I wonder how How you came to change And how you lost your way My life's just stayed the same Stay the same
