I'd like to get inside your head I'd like to get to know you better A full understanding is what I'm after Tell me will I ever Would you share what's on your mind Even at those times When you seem so far so far away Or will you still keep me at a distance When I'm here to listen And I won't turn away You don't wanna talk about why Why your world is upside down So when you're ready I'll be here It's you and your life I want to share I want to know got to know Will we ever meet will you come to me Will there ever be a day When you choose to come to me come to me You can have all the time You can ever need I won't rush you baby For you I'll be patient Waiting in anticipation For you there's been many changes In your life that you've been making Changes for the better Changes better late than never Let me be the one you turn to baby Be the one you tell your thoughts to Let me be the one that you reach for I really couldn't ask for more I couldn't ask for more no no Let me be the one The one and only one Be the one you trust Be the one you love Let me be the one Get to know you well Baby who will know Only time will tell
