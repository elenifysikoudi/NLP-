I didn't mean it and yet I cheated on you my love You my love my heart is beating Are you leaving me alone on my own And then the tears hit my eyes I miss you right by my side I'm waiting for you waiting for you Forgive me just one of my lies Release me from one alibi I gotta have you I gotta have you Chorus On and on your voice is calling On and on inside my mind Don't you know I can't let go Never never cause my love goes On and on Your voice is calling On and on inside my mind Don't you know I can't let go Never never cause my love goes on I didn't mean it and yet I cheated on you my love You my love my heart is beating Are you leaving me alone on my own And then the tears hit my eyes I miss you right by my side I'm waiting for you waiting for you Forgive me just one of my lies Release me from one alibi I gotta have you I gotta have you chorus
