"Pretty little baby Yeah yeah Pretty little baby Yeah yeah Pretty little baby you say that maybe You'll be thinkin of me And try to love me Pretty little baby I'm hoping that you do You can ask the flowers I sit for hours Tellin all the bluebirds the ""bill and coo"" birds Pretty little baby I'm so in love with you Now is just the time While both of us are young ""Puppy love"" must have it's day Don't cha know it's much more fun to love While the heart is young and gay Meet me at the car hop Or at the pop shop Meet me in the moonlight Or in the daylight Pretty little baby I'm so in love with you Pretty little baby I said ""Pretty little baby"" Oh now pretty little baby "
