After school I always had to work I kinda love feeling like a jerk Cause I never got to talk to the guy I liked And that ain't right And then he met another type Made him buy her all the things she liked I learned a lot about life When she jumped in his convertible Oooh la da da da Without a care in the world Oooh la da da da I'm not that kinda girl Rich kids Got a lot to say Rich kids Never have to pay Everything's funny when you're young with money And mommy and daddy will pay the way Rich kids Never go to jail Rich kids Never buy on sale Rich kids always have the most fun Man I wish that I was one A little later on in life When I finally get my money right It's still never enough For the stuck up types They say my money's new And she's got a better view As they sail away on her father's yacht This is what I got Oooh la da da da Without a care in the world Oooh la da da da I'm not that kinda girl Rich kids Got a lot to say Rich kids Never have to pay Everything's funny when you're young with money And mommy and daddy will pay the way Rich kids Never go to jail Rich kids Never buy on sale Rich kids always have the most fun Man I wish that I was one Maybe he's not for me Maybe he did me a favor Maybe he saved me some trouble down the line But maybe they're just like me Baby it's what they mean Don't judge a book by the cover Rich kids Got a lot to say Rich kids Never have to pay Everything's funny when you're young with money And mommy and daddy will pay the way Rich kids never go to jail Rich kids never buy on sale Everything's funny when you're young with money And mommy and daddy will pay the way Rich kids Never go to jail Rich kids Never buy on sale Rich kids always have the most fun Man I wish that I was one
