Here we are Underneath a million stars I want to believe that I'm in your mind I want to believe your love is blind Feelings can go away but How do I know who's to blame The stars come out when the dawn's asleep And your heaven takes hold of me Why do we feel In between the blur Is it real I want to believe that love is kind I want to believe that your love is blind Feelings can go away and How will I know who's to blame The stars come out when the dawn's asleep And heaven takes hold of me You gotta believe in something You gotta believe in something Believe in me believe in me Feelings can go away and How will I know who's to blame The stars come out when the dawn's asleep And heaven takes hold of me You gotta believe in something You gotta believe in something
