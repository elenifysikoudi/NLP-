She leads me to the bathroom stall Friends are waiting down the hall She takes my hand she won't let go feels so lonely and so cold so cold so lonely and so cold Got so many things to try By the birrors getting by Some will say that it kills Pain or pleasure pop the pills So cold so lonely and so cold Take cover Take cover Torture Chamber Lover Take cover Take cover Torture Chamber it's cold Got so many bills to pay Baby still wants to play Friends are waiting in the car I don't think we're gonna get that far So Cold so lonely and so cold Feel so lonely i could fly Write a new sky But she don't want to try I feel so empty we should land I'm just another man she leans on to stand Sitting in the bathroom stall she's got eyes like a doll she was raised in the malls downtown she'll learn to fall so cold so lonely and so cold
