Give me a moment Give me a clue Tell me anything as long as it's true Give me heartache That's what you do Tell me you want me I'm sick of being used I send my heart to you but you never cared You never do So build me your bridges Build me the moon Tell me you love me Tell me you love me soon You didn't know that I cry in my room every night Maybe it's not cause of you but it would be easier if you needed me too I send my heart to you but you never cared You never do So build me your bridges Build me the moon Tell me you love me Tell me you love me soon I cannot stop I cannot smile I know we weren't meant to be but I want you here with me So build me your bridges Build me the moon Tell me you love me So build me your bridges Build me the moon Tell me you love me Tell me you love me So build me your bridges Build me the moon Tell me you love me Tell me you love me So build me your bridges Build me the moon Tell me you love me Tell me you love me soon
