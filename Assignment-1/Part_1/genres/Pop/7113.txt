"If the waters cool I might just swim If the sun shines right I might be here all day I'd drift away In a sunken state I'm busy lappin it up I might be here all day With the tides and their little secrets Whispering to me to sleep Would you take away my weakness ""drift on Drift on"" If the waters cool I might just swim If the sun shines right I might be here all day I'd drift away In a sunken state I'm busy lappin it up I might be here all day With the ripples and their stories Cooking up a storm Will you carry all my weakness ""Drift on Drift on"" If the waters cool I might just swiiiiiiiiimmm I'd drift away in a sunken state I'm busy lappin it up I might be here all day With the under current lurking Watching sideways from afar Could you take away My weakness I'm not that strong You see I feel so heavy Without you And you say ""Drift on Drift on Drift on drift on Mmmm Stay strong Drift on"""
