Like home in a broken heart Took your innocence and left a scar Crossed lines and crushed your world And tore your soul in two Too young to knock your door Tried to miss our civil war Time left to comprehend What this could make of you Let it echo Is it waiting To determine what we will become You will be safe You will be free This won't decide who you're gonna be You will be safe You will be new The cycle will break The future will change And you will be sane Scared that your secret might come out And you're gonna lose the life you got now Caught in a loop and it winds you back But anything can change Take a chance now 'Cause it's waiting Share the truth now I knew a day would come yeah You will be safe You will be free This won't decide who you're gonna be You will be safe You will be new The cycle will break The future will change And you will be sane Scream it out loud And watch all of the pieces crumble down Oh yeah Consign it to me now 'Cause darling that's how freedom can be found And you will be safe You will be free And this won't decide who you're gonna be You will be safe You will be new The cycle will break The future will change And you will be sane You're sane You will be sane You're sane You will be sane
