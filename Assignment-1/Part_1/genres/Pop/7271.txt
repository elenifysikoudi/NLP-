You look around It's staring back at you Another wave of doubt Will it pull you under You wonder What if I'm overtaken What if I never make it What if no one's there Will you hear my prayer When you take that first step Into the unknown You know that He won't let you go So what are you waiting for What do you have to lose Your insecurities they try to alter you You know you're made for more So don't be afraid to move Your faith is all It takes in you You can walk on the water too So get out and let your fear fall to the ground No time to waste Don't wait Don't you turn around and miss out Everything you were made for I know you're not sure So you play it safe Try to run away If you take that first step Into the unknown He won't let you go So what are you waiting for What do you have to lose Your insecurities they try to alter you You know you're made for more So don't be afraid to move Your faith is all It takes in you You can walk on the water too Step Out Even when it's stormin' Step Out Even when you're broken Step Out Even when your heart is telling you telling you to give up Step Out When your hope is stolen Step Out You can't see where you're going You don't have to be afraid So what are you waiting for So what are you waiting for What do you have to lose Your insecurities they try to alter you You know you're made for more So don't be afraid to move Your faith is all It takes in you You can walk on the water too
