"Such an ugly girl Took another girl home Let her feast on a friendship That she'd never known She makes up these games to play But I'm not laughing along today Someone hatchets my life away No matter how hard that I try try You're always telling me ""bye bye"" And then I'm asking you but ""why why "" When you're running off again without a moment to explain You couldn't stand the fact You couldn't pull us apart Chasing home from you Running us down in the dark She uses affairs to say ""There's just one way and it's my way"" ""If you don't fit then you'll might as well "" No matter how hard that I try try You're always telling me ""bye bye"" And then I'm asking you but ""why why "" When you're running off again without a moment to explain You'll come around again I know it 'Cause when you think you've almost Blown it And I'll continue to Ignore it When you're running off again without a moment to explain How preoccupied You always seem to be Looking at strangers And suddenly we're three I'm moving over now I think you've had enough of me Oh You'll come around again I know it 'Cause when you think you've almost Blown it And I'll continue to Ignore it When you're running off again without a moment to explain You'll come around again You'll come around You'll come around again You'll come around You'll come around again You'll come around Oh You'll come around again You'll come around You'll come around again You'll come around You'll come around again You'll come around Oh"
