Long time ago in Bethlehem So the holy bible say Mary's boy child Jesus Christ Was born on Christmas Day Hark now hear the angels sing A new king born today And man will live forevermore Because of Christmas Day Trumpets sound and angels sing Listen what they say That man will live forevermore Because of Christmas Day While shepherds watch their flock by night They see a bright new shining star Then hear a choir sing The music seemed to come from afar Now Joseph and his wife Mary Come to Bethlehem that night Then find no place to born the child Not a single room was in sight Hark now hear the angels sing A new king born today And man will live forevermore Because of Christmas Day Trumpets sound and angels sing Listen what they say That man will live forevermore Because of Christmas Day By and by they find a little nook In a stable all forlorn And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born Long time ago in Bethlehem So the holy bible say Mary's boy child Jesus Christ Was born on Christmas Day Hark now hear the angels sing A new king born today And man will live forevermore Because of Christmas Day Trumpets sound and angels sing Listen what they say That man will live forevermore Because of Christmas Day Hark now hear the angels sing Listen what they say That man will live forevermore Because of Christmas Day
