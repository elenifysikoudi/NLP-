Try to remember the kind of September When life was slow and oh so mellow Try to remember the kind of September When grass was green and grain was yellow Try to remember the kind of September When you were a tender and callow fellow Try to remember and if you remember then follow follow Follow Try to remember when life was so tender That no one wept except the willow Try to remember when life was so tender That dreams were kept beside your pillow Deep in December it's nice to remember The fire of September that made us mellow Try to remember and if you remember then follow follow Follow follow Follow follow
