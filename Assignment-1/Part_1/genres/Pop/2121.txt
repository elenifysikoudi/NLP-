Here hold my breath Feel the tremble I know best The fear in my mind is the echo in my heart Cold and plain As you watch me Fall apart These tears are warmer than the sun The heart I share with you Maybe manic or diseased But always true If you keep me here you can chase away this pain I'm warm again and in your light I'll stay These tears are warmer than the sun
