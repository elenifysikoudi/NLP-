I say I've been meaning to move your way I hope that no one will make fun of me I go live in a new society I want to live in it live in it Want to learn want to live live want to learn Want to live it it live in it Oh I'm ready to learn I don't know is it the same for everyone Maybe that I've done something wrong Why do they call me names Outside will you come out and play with me I've been scrubbing at my skin you see But the color still remains on me I want to be the same be the same Want to be want to be the same as you Want to be the same be the same Oh I'm ready to go I don't know is it the same for everyone Maybe that I've done something wrong Why do they call me names
