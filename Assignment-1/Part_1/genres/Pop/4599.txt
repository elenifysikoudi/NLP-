sittin here just lookin outside at the rain fallin down it aint the same around here ever since the day that you walked out i tried to keep my composure so that i dont come undone missing you so much right now cause i treated you wrong did you know i pray that you'll come to me every night before i lay down to sleep baby if i cant be with you my sweet babe then i think im gonna take it out on me if i cant feel the warmness that you bring my hearts gonna take it out on me whats the point in moving on if i cant let you go memories wont leave me alone cause your all i know my heart is reaching but somehow i cant touch you hope its not too late and your in love with someone new did you know i pray that you'll come to me every night before i lay down to sleep baby if i cant be with you my sweet babe then i think im gonna take it out on me if i cant feel the warmness you bring my hearts gonna take it out on me repeat
