You've gotta lotta damn nerve She said you know Pretend you're fine And let her go She said Its cold now we're alone December dressed her in the snow She's said let's go You said you wanna go home But I can't take you there You'll change your mind when I'm not there Please let me sleep And please let me dream You're content in your bedroom With the ghosts of what we've been through singing Please let me sleep You'll never get back in you're all you've got now You can't remember when you last where so proud So count the wolves outside your bedroom dressed as sheep they're waiting for you now Seven years bad luck I must have done something really bad when I was young I regret you I wish I'd never even met you darling Please let me sleep And please let me dream You're content in your bedroom With the ghosts of what we've been through singing Please let me sleep
