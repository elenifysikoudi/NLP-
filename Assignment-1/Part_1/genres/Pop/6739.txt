What child is this Who meant to rest on Mary's lap is sleeping Who angels greet with anthem sweet While shepherds watch our keeping This this is Christ the King Whom shepherds guard and angels sing Haste haste to bring Him laud The babe the Son of Mary So bring him incense gold and myrrh Come peasant King to own him The King of kings salvation brings Let loving hearts enthrone Him This this is Christ the King Whom shepherds guard and angels sing Haste haste to bring Him laud The babe the Son of Mary Nails fierce shall pierce him through The cross be borne for me for you Hail hail the word made flesh Obeyed the Son of Mary This this is Christ the King Whom shepherds guard and angels sing Haste haste to bring Him laud The babe the Son of Mary Praise Him Son of joy Joy to the risen Lord Praise Him Son of joy Joy to the risen Lord This this is Christ the king Whom shepherds guard and angels sing Haste haste to bring Him laud The babe the Son of Mary
