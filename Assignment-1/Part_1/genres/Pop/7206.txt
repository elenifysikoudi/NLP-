Sunken sky of silver gray A shame they took the sun away I could have done with some Today the world's a shade of blue Decidedly because of you Honey I don't know why I've seen the sign the silhouettes the darker side I know so well I don't where I've fallen I don't where I've fallen Only one way to go I won't miss you Magic tales and pony tails and fingernails That should have been cleaned Yesterday far away The memories swell The minutes fade Hours pass and decades fail Honey I don't want to die And life is like unfaithful sand Slipping through this opened hand I don't where I've fallen I don't where I've fallen Only one way to go I won't miss you I won't miss you I won't miss you
