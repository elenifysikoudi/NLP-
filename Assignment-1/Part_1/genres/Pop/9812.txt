You are my life you are my love Now I've found you never want to be without you You know my heart you were my lover Lying with me sleeping softly There's no doubt inside my mind I really know Just hold my hand and I will never let you go I believe in love But as this night comes softly down As it surrounds us I need you now There will be times some rain will fall I'll be your shelter I'll fill your soul There's no doubt inside my mind I really know Just hold my hand and I will never let you go Chorus I believe in love I believe in love There's no way I'll loose my faith in you because I believe in love Close your eyes feel me now I will never let you down Close your eyes feel me now I will never let you down chorus repeat I will never let you down Close your eyes feel me now I will never let you down
