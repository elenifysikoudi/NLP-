I want to go to heaven so I build myself a tower a lonely pillar on the plain for no one else but me I want to taste the clouds between my sharpened teeth find out if I'm a demon or a saint in disguise I want to close the doors behind my bleeding back and dance among the shadows for future glory's lost I want to be religious to walk among the chosen and wear the mark of cain feel safe wihout regrets The version with this last verse is on Sequencer Beta I want a shining armour to burn my hate and fury until nothing still remains but pure thoughts of peaceful minds
