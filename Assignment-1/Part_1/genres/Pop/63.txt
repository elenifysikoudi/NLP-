"Miss Third Ward your first question What is your aspiration in life Oh my aspiration in life Waw that's a great question I wasn't expecting that question What is my aspiration in life Well my aspiration in life Would be to be happy Uh huh huh Uh huh huh Uh huh huh Mama said ""You're a pretty girl What's in your head it doesn't matter Brush your hair fix your teeth What you wear is all that matters "" Just another stage pageant the pain away This time I'm gonna take the crown Without falling down down down Pretty hurts We shine the light on whatever's worse Perfection is a disease of a nation Pretty hurts Pretty hurts Pretty hurts Shine the light on whatever's worse Tryin fix something but you can't fix what you can't see It's the soul that needs the surgery Uh huh huh Blonder hair flat chest TV says ""Bigger is better "" South beach sugar free Vogue says ""Thinner is better "" Just another stage pageant the pain away This time I'm gonna take the crown Without falling down down down Pretty hurts shine the light on whatever's worse Perfection is a disease of a nation Pretty hurts Pretty hurts Pretty hurts Pretty hurts Pretty hurts shine the light on whatever's worse Tryin to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see It's the soul that needs the surgery Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body It's the soul it's my soul that needs surgery It's my soul that needs surgery Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far And you break when the fake facades leave you in the dark You're left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl Pretty hurts shine the light on whatever's worse Pretty hurts Perfection is a disease of a nation Pretty hurts Pretty hurts Pretty hurts shine the light on whatever's worse Tryin to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see It's the soul that needs the surgery When you're alone all by yourself Pretty hurts Pretty hurts And you're lying in your bed Pretty hurts Pretty hurts Reflection stares right into you Pretty hurts Pretty hurts Are you happy with yourself Pretty hurts Pretty hurts You stripped away the masquerade Pretty hurts Pretty hurts The illusion has been shed Pretty hurts Pretty hurts Are you happy with yourself Pretty hurts Pretty hurts Are you happy with yourself Pretty hurts Pretty hurts Yes Uh huh huh"
