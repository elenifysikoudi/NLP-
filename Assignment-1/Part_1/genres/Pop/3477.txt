Verse 1 Late at night alone I was hoping you would show Just waiting for you Try to catch a light Out here on my own There ain't nowhere else to go I've checked in all the places you could hide Late at night alone I was hoping you would come from behind Cause I don't want to stay Out here on my own I was hoping you would show up behind We're headed the same way Chorus It's all I want It's all from dreaming To keep you here forever Verse 2 If I ever ride alone I would never let it go Or everyone could see how hard I tried I've never been so bold But these feelings let me go I never could've dreamed you'd pass me by The trail's gone cold Shine a light And lead me back your way The story's that I've told The curtains unfold Make it by and make sure that it stays Chorus
