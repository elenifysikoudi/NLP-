Dreams they come Plans they change Yea we're gonna break Yea we're gonna break Things we face make us who we are Baby you're a star shining in the dark Let's go back to the summer summer when We dreamed in love let's go back again Let's go back again Yea back again my friend To the summer when I'm holding a picture from seven years back I smile at the memory it's smiling right back at me and I see Brown hair and bright eyes such a beautiful blue A heart full of laughter with nothing to lose That's how I remember you You were young you were free And you dared to believe You could be the girl Who could change the world Then your life took a turn And you fell and it hurt But you're still that girl And you're gonna change this world Woh oh oh oh oh You're still that girl You're still that girl Woh oh oh oh oh You're still that girl You're still that girl Sometimes life don't go the way you planned And we all have days when we just don't understand Searching for meaning it's not always easy But your story's not over it's still being told Your sunrise is coming without letting go Let's go back again To the summer when You were young you were free And you dared to believe You could be the girl Who could change the world Then your life took a turn And you fell and it hurt But you're still that girl And you're gonna change this world Woh oh oh oh oh You're still that girl You're still that girl Woh oh oh oh oh You're still that girl You're still that girl What if the picture is bigger than you see And God has you right where he wants you to be Just listen to your heart He's telling you with every beat You're still that girl You were young you were free And you dared to believe You could be the girl Who could change the world Then your life took a turn Don't you know Don't you see But you're still that girl And you're gonna change this world Woh oh oh oh oh You're still that girl You're still that girl Woh oh oh oh oh You're still that girl You're still that girl I see it in your eyes I see it in your smile You're still that girl You're still that girl
