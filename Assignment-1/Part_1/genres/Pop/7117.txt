If I find that love I've known before I will never ever Never ever let it go If I find That love I've known before You know I could never let it go Away Not again this time I could never let it go Ohh Another song about love Gone right Ooh But my stories are to sweet If I find That love I've known before You know I could never let it go Away Not again this time Ah ah never ever I could never let it go Away Not again this time I will never let it go Ohh How about a round of applause For love Aah I loved the show and loved the cast One thing The end It surely seemed blue If I find Tht lvoe I've known before You know I could never let it go Away Not again this time Ah ah never ever I could never let it go No Away No not again this time I could never let it go Ohhhh Never ever Ohhh Never let it go ohhhh What so ever now No no no no no nono no never ever No no no no what so ever now
