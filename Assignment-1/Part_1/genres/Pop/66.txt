When you were born The angels sighed in delight They never thought They'd see such a beautiful sight You took the breath and the world was right again Tears were shed how we have been blessed And your love it shines so bright You bring me back to life back to life You make everything right And your love it shines so bright You bring me back to life back to life You got a light inside light inside God made you beautiful You're beautiful
