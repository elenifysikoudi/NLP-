Impotence the price of a dark affair It's more than a bellyache There's something alive in here What do I what do I care now that it's over What do I care I what do I care now that it's over Splinters shatter my one track mind I lie on a sea of nails and thorns Spitting out the same old line Oh what do I what do I care now that it's over What do I care I what do I care now that it's over Now you shoot me down Serenade my ears my heart I'm falling falling Echoing your sound Winter's breath all fall down Spin me out and spin me round Enter darkness enter lies oh no What do I what do I care now that it's over What do I care I what do I care now that it's over Now you shoot me down serenade my ears my heart I'm falling falling echoing your sound
