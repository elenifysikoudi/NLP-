You're bankrupt in your Bankrupt in your heart Don't even look at me My words could shatter glass And as a toy soldier from my past Have no use for you I took you off my shelf Don't you know I'm here for someone else Don't be so charming Don't be so charming Severely lonely But that doesn't bother me I got a boy on the corner Who'd love to be kissing me hugging me holding me tight I won't feel the need to call you at night No no no no no I take it back All I've ever said All the things I never really meant Take me back I want my toy soldier It's okay if we play pretend I promise to forget You're plastic and on my shelf Let's fake romance And I'll be someone else Don't even touch me My hands are cold as ice And as a toy soldier in my life Have nothing left to give And all this fighting hurts The more I yell at you The less you seem to learn No no no no no I take it back All I've ever said All the things I never really meant Take me back I want my toy soldier It's okay if we play pretend I promise to forget you're plastic And on my shelf Let's fake romance and I'll be someone else You're bankrupt in your bankrupt in your heart You're bankrupt in your bankrupt in your heart But I still feel the need To see you through the night
