I never thought I could not know Hard as I tried I'd have to let go I never dreamed How this would feel Torn at the seams And all is revealed And it's too late Baby you've changed You used to love me but Now you're not sure with My heart broken I leave Through your door It feels like I'm losing myself again This time it's really over I always thought That we were strong But looking back Guess I was wrong Where did it change I still don't know Nothing remains Nothing to show And it's too late Maybe you've changed Yeah yeah yeah Maybe you don't understand what I'm feeling I figured it out the reason I'm leaving You used to love me but Now you're not sure with My heart broken I leave Through your door It feels like I'm losing myself again This time it's really over This time it's really over
