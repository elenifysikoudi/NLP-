To think I sit around in my dressing gown Try to get Over you Don't think I'm shedding tears Because I want you near it's not true I'm over you I Don't think that you should come around No No and try to make it better somehow 'cause I'm not in love I'm not in love I'm not in love with you And I don't care what you heard I'm not feeling hurt it's not true I'm over you Not scared to venture out or see you in a crowd At a place we both know Haven't put my life on hold ever since I let you go It's not true I'm over you I don't think you should come round No No Or listen to the rumours that I'm down 'cause I'm not in love not in love I'm not in love with you And I Don't care what you heard I'm not feeling hurt It's not true I don't want you Think I'll flip the station cause the song they're playing Reminds me of you I know it's not true I'm not calling you hanging up When I get blue 'cause I'm not in love not in love I'm not in love with you And I Don't care what you've heard I'm not feeling hurt its not true I'm over with you 'cause I m not in love with you
