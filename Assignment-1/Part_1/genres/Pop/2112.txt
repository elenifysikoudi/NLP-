Taking in the rhythm of the world let your mind tell you the words stay within the river I have loved with my own sense of good and I write you once or twice with an eye like a firefly taste the cooler water breathe the air let in your want of life and air we will take on any problem in the world if our own are understood and I write you in more than blood and I hope that you see I know that someday in your eyes I see someday in your words I am reminded in your eyes I see someday we will pray through all the weather to tame the world for all life knows good I will save you from the wicked I will take the world in my arms my own sense of the word and I write you only lies can you see they are my disguise I know that someday in your eyes I see someday in your words I am reminded in your eyes I see someday
