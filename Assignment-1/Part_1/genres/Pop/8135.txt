Verse 1 To the naked eye he's just an old man Somebody you can easily pass by He'll be the first to reach out his hand He knows a thing or two about a hard life When they touch and they smile as hurry on to where you're going Your whole life changes for good without you even knowing Chorus I still believe that walking among us there are angels Doing extraordinary things Yeah It's plain to see them They're all around us Angels Some of them just don't have wings Verse 2 There's a lady you keep running into Never heard her say much of anything But her eyes seem to look right through you Right to the bottom of your pain You take a breath bow your head As you stop and just around the corner Without a word being said you know she's watching over your shoulder Chorus I still believe that I still believe walking among us there are angels Doing extraordinary things Yeah It's plain to see them It's plain to see They're all around us Angels Some of them just don't have wings Bridge It's the life saving hand of a stranger A little girl who hands you a flower there's a power That comes when you believe there's so much more than you can see I still believe that there are angels among us Doing extraordinary things Yeah Chorus I still believe They're all around us Angels Some of them just don't have wings I still believe that I still believe walking among us there are angels Doing extraordinary things Whoa It's plain to see It's plain to see them It's plain to see They're all around us Angels Outro Some of them just don't have Some just don't have Some of them just don't have wings Yeaaah Yeah
