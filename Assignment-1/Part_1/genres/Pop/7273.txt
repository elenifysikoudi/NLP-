Today today you wanna run away now You brake to keep it together love Love is all you need you're a queen but you'll never know it Life has come and left you blinded Stole your smile left you crying It's not your fault shame is all you've got now Your heart is tangled up in silence It's time to let go And feel the light find the light I know it's easier to hide But you gotta let go And feel the light let go and feel the light Be brave brave the waters all around you I'll stay I'll keep you from sinking down Love Love is on your side it's stronger than you'll ever know So many years of quiet Building up like a fire inside Feeling like you gotta let it out now Just let it out Your heart is tangled up in silence It's time to let go And feel the light find the light I know it's easier to hide But you gotta let go And feel the light let go and feel the light How did you get here Your locked inside of all this fear Inside you're crying out Your mind's at war Get out get out and live for more There's so much more Live for more Your heart is tangled up in silence It's time to let go And feel the light find the light I know it's easier to hide But you gotta let go And feel the light let go and feel the light Brave brave waters all around you I'll stay I'll keep you from sinking down
