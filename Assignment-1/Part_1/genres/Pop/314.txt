There's noone I'd rather be with on this winter night Sharing this beautiful moment with you right by my side Oh baby you're all that I need in my life don't carry the world on your shoulders Together we'll turn wrong to right stay with me baby on this warm winter night Uuuuu on this warm winter night uuuuu We've crossed so many oceans to cover the stars above Memories most cherished are all with you my love Oh baby you're all that I need in my life don't carry the world on your shoulders Together we'll turn wrong to right stay with me baby on this warm winter night Uuuuu on this warm winter night uuuuu Turn the lights down low let me hear your whisper Hear your heart beat slow now you're breathing deeper The will come everyday in my arms you will stay And ooo even when your feet won't touch the ground not even the world can hold us down You and me together I'll hold on forever Uuuuu on this warm winter night Uuuuu on this warm winter night I'll hold on to you your love pulls me through Tonight I'll hold on to you I can feel you now your love around wanna hold you now keep you safe and sound Oooooo this warm winter night
