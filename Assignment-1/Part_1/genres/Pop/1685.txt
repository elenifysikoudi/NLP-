Amazing grace how sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now am found Was blind but now I see Twas grace that taught my heart to fear And grace my fears relieved How precious did that grace appear The hour I first believed Amazing grace how sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now am found Was blind but now I see Though many dangers toils and snares I have already come Twas grace that brought me safe thus far And grace will lead me home
