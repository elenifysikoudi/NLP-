As I wake up from my sleep I was dreaming I was in the North Pole Ice beneath my feet So beautiful it seemed Then I realized I would never be warm Without you next to me Voices in my head Wake up you wake up and you run to her After all the time we spent I messed up but I can't take anymore Oohh she's like an open book I sat and read it all And understand that when I slip I fall And oohh she's like an open book I passed the pages through And in the end I'm always back with you A chill runs down my spine Oh I can't take it Memories when you used to be mine The angel on my left shoulder He's singing sad songs to me Sad songs to me sad songs to me The demon on the right screamed over He said you'll be just fine why can't you see Why can't you see Oohh she's like an open book I sat and read it all And understand that when I slip I fall And oohh she's like an open book I passed the pages through And in the end I'm always back with you You're all I see You know I mean it I'll be there when you need me I wanted to say I want you to stay So please take me back Don't go away Oohh I should have never let you go Oohh Oohh she's like an open book I sat and read it all And understand that when I slip I fall And oohh she's like an open book I passed the pages through And in the end I'm always back with you You're all I see You know I mean it I'll be there when you need me I wanted to say I want you to stay So please take me back Don't go away
