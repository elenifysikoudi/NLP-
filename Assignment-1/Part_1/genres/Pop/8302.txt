If you leave me now If you leave me tonight I will die Wait till tomorrow Don't leave me now Don't leave me now If you say goodbye If you do it tonight I will cry Wait till tomorrow Don't say goodbye Don't say goodbye Don't take me down You make me feel like a stranger To your eyes to your eyes If you say goodbye I can't exist If you say goodbye I can't resist Everytime you go Everytime you say goodbye Everytime you go Everytime I want to cry Please don't leave me now If you leave me now If you leave me tonight I will die Wait till tomorrow Don't leave me now Don't leave me now Don't take me down You make me feel like a stranger To your eyes to your eyes Please don't leave me now
