Sunset stole the light The color in your eyes And everything in sight Was lost in the wind You lost us in the wind Light it up and let it go Don't you see that you are not alone Light it up and watch it fly 'Cause you could go anywhere you want tonight Light it up light it up Light it up light it up I could wear the weight Take it all the way Every creature's fate Is theirs and theirs alone It's yours and yours alone So light it up and let it go Don't you see that you are not alone Light it up and watch it fly 'Cause you can go anywhere you want tonight So light it up light it up Light it up light it up Light it up light it up Light it up light it up Light it up and watch it fly 'Cause you could be anything you want tonight 'Cause it could be a beautiful morning Yes it can be a beautiful morning Everything you never said And all the things you thought instead And everyone you never knew And everywhere you're going to And every song you wanna sing And every smile as it begins It's yours and yours alone Yes it's yours and yours alone Instead it's yours and yours alone So light it up and let it go Don't you see that you are not alone Just light it up and watch it fly 'Cause you can go anywhere you want tonight Light it up and let it go Don't you see that you are not alone Light it up and watch it fly 'Cause you can be anything you want tonight It could be a beautiful morning It could be a beautiful morning 'Cause it could be a beautiful morning
