Who is this stranger Who breaks ev'ry rule The Hightwayman He isn't a rogue and he isn't a fool The Highwayman He is dashing and daring The devil may care The Highwayman With a glint in his eye And the wind in his hair The Highwayman Who is the Highwayman Who is the Highwayman He's rough but he's handsome He's gentle but strong The Highwayman They say he's a nobleman Who has gone wrong The Highwayman He'll take all your jewels But do it with style The Highwayman As he pockets your diamonds He'll flash you a smile The Highwayman Who is the Highwayman Who is the Highwayman I've never known anyone like him He's like no one that I've ever met How easy he'll be to remember How hard he will be to forget He's stolen for Princes He's stolen form Earls The Highwayman But his greatest pleasure Is stealing from girls The Highwayman You'll feel empty inside When you see him depart The Highwayman You may not realize But he's stolen your heart The Highwayman Who is the Highwayman Who is the Highwayman
