In between the truth And what I see or what I feel or what I've become Is still an aching need And I'm hardly even alive I'm feeling like a murderous vine You are my mirror And I'm on my knees pleading You are my mirror Oh don't stop loving me I can see the changes within me What I feel or what I need or what I've become I still feel I'm your slave and I hardly ever lie I need you like my faith in the divine You are my mirror And I'm on my knees bleeding You are my mirror Oh don't stop loving me
