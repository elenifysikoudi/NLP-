If you go away then I will know My feelings are nothing but a curtain Hiding me from what I should know That I'm a pilot and I'm steering low We discussed life in the back of my car the back of your van You know the psychic said that you should be my man We exchanged words and we acted old We both knew the wine was cheap And I'm a pilot and I am steering deep And when I say that you should stay Remember what I'm drinking's cheap And I'm a pilot and I am steering deep
