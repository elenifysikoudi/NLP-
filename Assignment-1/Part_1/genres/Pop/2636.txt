I'm a thousand people From day to day We are all airborne Without ground control I call my name In the maelstrom I'm not givin in So don't you give in I'll be your Atlas And carry our world But I guess I won't save the world today I'm just trying to survive And perhaps I'll dream again But I will find my cross And I will take us home But I guess I won't save the world today I'm a thousand people From day to day Blues and so untitled On the road to where I'm losing my name In the maelstrom But I'm not givin in So don't you give in I'll be your Atlas And carry us home But I guess I won't save your world today But I guess I won't save the world today I'm just trying to survive And perhaps I'll dream again But I will find my cross And I will take us home But I guess I won't save the world today I'm just trying to survive And perhaps I'll dream again But I will find my cross And I will take us home But I guess I won't save the world today
