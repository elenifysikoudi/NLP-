There was a time When I knew nothing about love A silly little girl Masking her feelings from the world You bring me so much joy And I thank God from up above Right now I know that what I'm feeling is true love I love you I love you I never thought that I could feel this way I never thought that we would go all the way I never thought that I could form my lips to say I love you I love you I love you Since you've gone away the days are long And my love grows stranger I can't hide these tears And yet my heart it grows fonder The love I feel for you is like a child on Christmas day You taught me how to love and just how to communicate That's why I sing this song to you and to only you I love you I love you Love that brings me joy It feels so natural Innocent and pure so unconditional So emotional
