No one knows her I have seen you hold her trembling arms and fiery eyes things you tell her she wont remember the moment is all she holds in hand I can see her smile I can say her name the face I see we are both the same If I am her why do I damn her am I hoping she will slowly slip away am I hoping she will drown and slip away years have passed her and many asked her like quiet knights in a church bells ring if you take her you will never break her don't give her dreams she will only slip away am I hoping she will drown and slip away am I hoping I will only slip away if only this time I would know she fakes her mind out in an open door she is waiting and I know there is still some light around her eyes she will make a sad song and you knew it was not funny she is only seeing you the way the way a madman feels inside a lifeless body and I know she is only seeing me the way am I hoping she will slowly slip away am I hoping I will drown and slip away
