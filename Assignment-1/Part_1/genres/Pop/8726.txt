I see you in the crowd A million people loud You try to hide But something make you call out I gotcha falling hard You make me drop my guard We try to fight it But somethings written in the stars I just can't shake this feeling It's just like a bullet and its killing me Two hearts that need some healing You know what you do to me Its time to surrender Cause I can remember A love that was strong enough To not run away Its time to surrender I'm givin into ya And you're giving into me So give it away yeah Everybody needs somebody Reaching out so take it from me Everybody take this from me Find the one surrender give it away Stuck in another life I swear I've known you twice If this is destiny Time for us to roll the dice Your heart was Novocaine Cut off to numb the pain You took me in And nothings ever been the same I just can't shake this feeling It's just like a bullet and its killing me Two hearts that need some healing You know what you do to me Everybody needs somebody Reaching out so take it from me Everybody take this from me Find the one surrender give it away Over me Somethings coming over me Theres no telling what we'll be But somethings coming over me Over me Somethings coming over me Theres no telling what we'll be But somethings coming over me Everybody needs somebody Reaching out so take it from me Everybody take this from me Find the one surrender give it away Surrender
