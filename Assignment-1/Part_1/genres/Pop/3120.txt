I see the pain in your face i can tell you want me to feel the same you say don't look at me like that i don't even know why you came but i'm standing and i'm still staying and you may never want me ever again as you wonder to yourself is this really the end take it yeah yeah yeah but don't forget that you got it from me you don't own me and i don't own you but somehow we're still trying to understand the reason why we hurt each other is cause we can yet there's something that glows inside of me that's the same thing that glows inside of you and if you open up your shades of lead i'll open mine too
