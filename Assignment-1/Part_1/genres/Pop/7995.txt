Long time ago in Bethlehem So the Holy Bible say Mary's boy child Jesus Christ Was born on Christmas day Hark now hear the angels sing New King's born today And we will live forevermore Because of Christmas day While shepherds watch their flock by night They saw a bright new shining star and we will live forever more because of Christmas Day Hark now hear the angels sing New King's born today And we will live forevermore Because of Christmas day Now Joseph and his wife Mary Came to Bethlehem that night They found no place to bare her child Not a single room was in sight By and by they find a little nook In a stable all forlorn And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little Boy Child was born Trumpets sound and angels sing Listen what they say That we will live forevermore Because of Christmas day Because of Christmas day Evermore
