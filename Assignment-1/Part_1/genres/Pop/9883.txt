Like an astronaut that's scared of heights With a heart that's beating at the speed of light You've been waiting for this feeling all your life Sometimes it's just hard to realize When you're stuck in a moment And your spark has been stolen This is our time to own it So own it Baby we were born with Fire n gold in our eyes eyes With fire n gold in our eyes eyes With our light in a bottle Hands on the throttle Even in the dust we shine With fire n gold in our eyes eyes There is something different about you and I about you and I And I feel like I have knew you my whole life There is beauty behind every tears you've cried Sometimes it's just hard to realize When you're stuck in a moment And your spark has been stolen This is our time to own it So own it Baby we were born with Fire n gold in our eyes eyes With fire n gold in our eyes eyes With our light in a bottle Hands on the throttle Even in the dust we shine With fire n gold in our eyes eyes There is love inside this madness We are walking on the moon Though I don't believe in magic I believe in me and you I believe in me and you I believe in me and you Baby we will fall with Fire n gold in our eyes eyes With fire n gold in our eyes eyes With our light in a bottle Hands on the throttle Even in the dust we shine With fire n gold in our eyes
