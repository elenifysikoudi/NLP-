"Actually you are wrong or at least misled in your assertion of the accuracy of the lyrics for Sweet Little Jesus Boy on the Andy Williams Christmas Album The third line from the end as sung by Andy Williams is the following ""Born long ago"" Not ""born a long ago "" No ""a"" prior to ""long "" which is silly and awkward even to sing to saythe least Simply listen to the song to hear how Williams only uses the 3 words set forth above and if the writers of this version of the song submitted their lyrics with the silly ""a"" included thankfully Mr Williams corrected the silliness in how he sings it on his Christmas Album "
