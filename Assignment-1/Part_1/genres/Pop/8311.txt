I sit in silence Underneath the moonlight A thousand stars are melting in my eyes I've hidden secrets and lost my sense of living And everything I've always needed You are the one baby come here Feel my heart beat You are the one baby come here I'm giving you everything I'm falling in love again oh baby I'm giving you everything I'm falling in love again oh oh I feel so lonely Underneath the moonlight My sense of blame is hurting me so much I want you baby to tell you what I'm feeling This love is rising deep inside me You are the one baby come here Feel my heart beat You are the one baby come here I'm giving you everything I'm falling in love again oh baby I'm giving you everything I'm falling in love again oh oh I'm giving you everything
