We were like two birds flying so high as the clouds We were so silly in love But things changed you became possessive You're not the man I used to know Why did you change on me Think about your mama Before you take me low Treat me with respect That should be the way it goes I know you're not my daddy I refuse to be controlled Treat me with respect That should be the way it goes chorus Think before you disrespect me Think before you play your silly games Think before you scream at me Think before you call me out my name You better think about every little thing That you do to me Cause a stone'll happen to you Think before you cheat on me Think before you take her home tonight Think before you say your sorry Think before it's too late stop wasting time Better think about every little thing That you do to me 'Cause a stone'll happen to you Boy I won't be with you if you won't respect me Will never happen so you better think If you treat me right I'm gon make you happy So you better think
