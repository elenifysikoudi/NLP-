When marimba rhythms start to play Dance with me make me sway Like a lazy ocean hogs the shore Hold me close sway me more Like a flower bending in the breeze Bend with me sway with ease When we dance you have a way with me Stay with me sway with me Other dancers may be on the floor Dear but my eyes with see only you Only you have the magic technique When we sway I go weak I can hear the sound of violins Long before it begins Make me thrill as only you know how Sway me smooth sway me now Other dancers may be on the floor Dear but my eyes with see only you Only you have the magic technique When we sway I go weak Like a flower bending in the breeze Bend with me sway with ease When we dance you have a way with me Stay with me sway with me When marimba rhythms start to play Dance with me make me sway Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore Hold me close sway me more Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore Hold me close sway me more Hold me close sway me more Sway me now
