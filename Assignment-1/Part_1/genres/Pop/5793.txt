Well you think I'm free but I cost money yeah you're gonna be my sugar mama if you wanna be my honey Don't want no woman with empty pockets Cause she's better buy the gold if she wants her picture in a golden locket Well my baby gonna buy me dinner tonight She gonna take me to the movies She don't need no Diamond Ring Well my baby gonna treat me like she knows is right And that's alright with me Bada boom bada bling She can buy herself a diamond ring Aaooo cha ching I'ma sit around and do my thing Well Sasha's she be talkin fierce again Saying women runnin runnin the world But if a lady wanna do all the dirty work Now that's my kinda girl Yeah She foots the bill puts my name in her will And I don't need to be in denial Cause she can take care of everything Hillary Clinton Style
