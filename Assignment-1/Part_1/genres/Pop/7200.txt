Shattered glass shooting stars silver sparks Come and shine on me Take your time don't hurry baby Break a smile when you come to me I'm up on a high Catch me if you fall Up on a high Your love fills me like a waterfall Iris art skin on skin let me in Take a ride with me Take a trip don't worry baby Love the way we satisfy a need I'm up on a high Catch me if you fall Up on a high Catch me if you fall You love fills me like a waterfall Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love
