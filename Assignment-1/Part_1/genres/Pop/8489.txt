A picture of yourself Armed with all you'll know Stabbing through the dark For a place to go It's the pages it's the past It's the roots that trip that grow Search yourself for something For something you've not done Bothered off and living A life of your own In the city where convenience Is the throw of a stone How are you supposed to know How you are supposed to go So you take to living Living is all you`ve got Dodge the fake and fiending And all the things you're not All the love you'd give But your heart's still un caught How are you supposed to know How you are supposed to go If you'd take the time to cut once you measure twice To find out the best things to know A dream in rewind like you're a man of the mice To find out the best way to go Wouldn't that be nice if you could cut once you measured twice How are you supposed to know how you are supposed to go
