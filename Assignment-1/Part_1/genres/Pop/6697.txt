Oh I carry a photograph Girl of the way you used to be Love looking back at me now it's just a memory You were all laughter then And you were my light when it was dark How did we lose our way how did we fall apart 'Cause something in our kisses Said love would never end And deep down you still feel it too But you won't let me in So when you smile like Mona Lisa My heart falls to pieces Cause smiling just can't hide All the sadness in your eyes If I could only hold you Love you like I used to But girl what can I do When you smile like Mona Lisa The way that I held you close The way that you whispered my name We made a work of art Know there's just an empty frame All we had Baby we could have again And deep down you still feel it too But you won't let me in So when you smile like Mona Lisa My heart falls to pieces Cause smiling just can't hide All the sadness in your eyes If I could only hold you Love you like I used to But girl what can I do When you smile like Mona Lisa So when you smile like Mona Lisa My heart falls to pieces Cause smiling just can't hide All the sadness in your eyes If I could only hold you Love you like I used to But girl what can I do When you smile like Mona Lisa I carry a photograph Girl of the way you used to be
