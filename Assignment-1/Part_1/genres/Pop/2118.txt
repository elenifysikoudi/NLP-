Unknown seems to rush through my veins So far you've been this close to me You can share my words You can feel my breath So far you've been this close to me I feel this ever lucid song I'll never learn The quiet street where you held me I feel love I've never known And when you speak do you speak to me So far you feel this close to real If you share my world you can take my breath away So far you've been this close to me And it feels like water through my hand You see life is a million grains of sand I feel this ever lucid song I'll never know The quiet street you hold me I feel love I've never known Unknown seems to rush through my veins So far you feel this close to me I can feel this time it's closer to the fire than I So far you've been this close to me And it feels like water through my hand You seem close but times a million grains of sand I feel this heady lucid sigh I will never learn These quiet streets will you help me I feel love I've never known I feel this senseless peace yes I will never learn Close my eyes sleep dream where I keep this locked I'll never know Lose my mind Unknown seems to rush through my veins So far you been this close to me
