I feel vulnerable I'm scared I hang on to every word like there's a hidden meaning It caught me unprepared Now I'm climbing up the wall that stands between us I keep hoping it's my imagination Playing tricks with my heart on this occasion But I've just got this sinking feeling So who's gonna drown now the dam's about to break Tell me if it's me I've gotta know I'm strong enough to tell you that it's more than I can take I'm just hanging by a thread Got a feeling I'm in over my head Can't wait until tomorrow I've gotta know tonight I feel naked in your eyes I'm so out of control it feels like I'm free wheeling Are we running out of time I've gotta find a way to stop this feeling I keep hoping it's my imagination Playing tricks with my heart on this occasion But I've just got this sinking feeling So who's gonna drown now the dam's about to break Tell me if it's me I've gotta know I'm strong enough to tell you that it's more than I can take I'm just hanging by a thread Got a feeling I'm in over my head Can't wait until tomorrow I've gotta know tonight Cause when you pull back the covers It's one way or the other oh yeah It's getting closer to midnight I've gotta go Can't wait until tomorrow I've gotta know So who's gonna drown now the dam's about to break Tell me if it's me I've gotta know I'm strong enough to tell you that it's more than I can take I'm just hanging by a thread Got a feeling I'm in over my head Can't wait until tomorrow I've gotta know tonight
