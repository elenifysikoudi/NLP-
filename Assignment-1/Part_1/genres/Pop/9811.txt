In this life we all search for something Something good and something oh so pure Well I believe that if you find that one thing You must fight for then you will be sure Chorus Could it be that I have found an angel I can see heaven in your eyes In my soul I never will be lonely For there will be an angel by my side There were times I never thought I'd make it Never dreamed I'd find someone like you Who'd be there when days were at their darkest Watching over everything I do Chorus Could it be that I have found an angel I can see heaven in your eyes In my soul I never will be lonely For there will be an angel by my side There will be an angel by my side Could it be that I have found an angel I can see heaven in your eyes In my soul I never will be lonely There will be an angel by my side In my soul I never will be lonely For there will be an angel by my side
