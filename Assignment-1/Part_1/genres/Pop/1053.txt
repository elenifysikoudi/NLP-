I can keep canaries and cook on a camper stove eat baked beans with a spoon and smell of ginger beer I can potter into town and pick up your prescriptions and if you're ever sad I'll pull potatoes from your ears potatoes from your ears Someday when I'm older I will Rock upon a porch with you Rock upon a porch with you Remembering the stupid things we did when we were young A hard boiled egg and soldiers in a cafe with an ocean view sitting silently across from you sipping strawberry daiquiris and twiddling our thumbs till we grow old I just want to quietly collect up my cavalry Curl up into a little ball and plot my revenge and it might sound stupid but the saddest thing about growing up is that I will never think I'm spiderman again I'm spiderman again Someday when I'm older I will Rock upon a porch with you Rock upon a porch with you Remembering when I was young and I still had my own teeth and it's sad to think that there might still be dreams of ours that won't come true they probably never will come true and we'll regret the things we didn't do and suck on travel sweets till we grow old Someday when I'm older I will Rock upon a porch with you Rock upon a porch with you Remembering the price of Polos and the books we used to read 'cause somehow after everything and everyone that we've been through I'm kind of looking forward to rocking back and forth with you on the front steps of our sweet retirement home
