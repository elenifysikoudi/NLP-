Dont look up unless youre leaning on a wall Or youll fall over you'll fall over Dont look down until youre ready for that fall And youll be flying you'll be flying Dont remember any memory at all And youll be laughing you'll be laughing Look up at the big sky mind It makes you feel so small Dont look back at all the things youll never know That never ending never ending Dont return to where you never meant to go Or keep on moving keep on moving Dont belong to any corner of the world Dont be a stranger be a stranger Look up at the big sky mind It makes you feel so small Look up at the big sky mind It makes you feel so small
