"The tears have all been shed now Weve said our last goodbyes His souls been blessed Hes laid to rest And its now I feel alone He was more than just my father My teacher my best friend He can still be heard In the tunes we shared When we play them on my own chorus I never will forget him For he made me ""what I am"" Though he may be gone Memories linger on And I miss him the old man As a boy hed take me walking By mountain field and stream And he'd show me things Not known to kings And secret between him and me Like the colors of the pheasant As he rises in the dawn Or how to fish and make a wish Beside the fairy tree chorus I never will forget him For he made me ""what I am"" Though he may be gone Memories linger on And I miss him the old man I thought hed live forever He seemed so big and strong But the minutes fly And the years roll by For a father and a son And suddenly when it happened There was so much left unsaid No second chance To tell him thanks For everything hed done chorus Oh I never will forget him For he made me ""what I am"" Though he may be gone Memories linger on God I miss him the old man"
