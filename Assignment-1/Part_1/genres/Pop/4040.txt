"""I have returned to the northern skies"" I have returned to the northern skies Where the summer had not touched The clouds that pass above Oh and I have returned to the somber grace Of the days too early to come and too early to stay Oh I have left a million stars And an ocean light and clearly blue I have left the warmth of the sun And a million adventures not yet begun For once there was beauty here for me Under the wide Northern skies And once there was magic here for me Under the wide Northern skies I saw trees as green and as dark as blue I break in poetry the deeper roots And now I know this is lonely country And it leads me only back to the sea I have returned to Northern skies Where summer hasn't touched The clouds that pass above I have returned to the somber grace Days too early to come too early to stay And once there was beauty here for me Under the wide Northern skies And once there was magic here for me Under the wide Northern skies Mmm mmm Mmm mmm Mmm mmm I have returned Mmm mmm I have returned Ohh ohh I have returned Mmm mmm"
