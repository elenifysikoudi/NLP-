Now that it's over Now that you're not here I have to start over but when I begin I'm lost inside my head I can't remember A day without you here Piecing the puzzle of memories I'm guarding and all that was left unsaid I don't know where your heart is Don't know I'm up too late But I will find a way Can you hear me now Through all of the world I'm screaming My words will reach you somehow somehow Can you hear me now 'Cause every word I'm breathing And you're a thousand miles away I knew when I saw you The day when we first met I'd say anything just to stop your world And my love has never left I did not hold the answers Didn't know the story's end But did my words find you then
