I wonder if I take you there would you believe in fairy tales oh A place where no one feels the pain living without suffering The roads are paved by loving hands Energy from turning friends oh So won't you open up your eyes So you can see this paradise oh I won't die to get to mine I want this thing alive I'll take my paradise on earth yeah I'll make my paradise on earth oh oh I'll make my paradise on earth I'll take my paradise on earth I'll make my paradise on earth It's easier when you believe Some people rather misery But I prefer a place you and I are free The whole world sings in unity I won't die to get to mine I want this thing alive I'll take my paradise on earth yeah I'll make my paradise on earth oh oh I'll make my paradise on earth I'll take my paradise on earth I'll make my paradise on earth And all of the world you were standing around You couldn't smile cause trouble's all you find So now that you're around and there's no going back I'll save you a spot next to me yeah I won't die to get to mine I want this thing alive I'll take my paradise on earth yeah I'll make my paradise on earth oh oh I'll make my paradise on earth I'll take my paradise on earth I'll take my paradise on earth yeah I'll make my paradise on earth oh oh I'll take my paradise on earth I'll make my paradise on earth
