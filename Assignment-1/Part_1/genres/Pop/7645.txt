If you see me walking down the street And I start to cry each time we meet Walk on by walk on by Make believe that you don't see the tears Just let me grieve in private 'Cause each time I see you I break down and cry Walk on by don't stop Walk on by don't stop And walk on by I just can't get over losing you And so if I seem broken and blue Walk on by walk on by Foolish pride that's all that I have left So let me hide the tears and the sadness You gave me when you said goodbye Walk on by don't stop Walk on by don't stop Walk on by don't stop Walk on Walk on by walk on by Foolish pride that's all that I have left So let me hide the tears and the sadness You gave me when you said goodbye Walk on by don't stop Walk on by don't stop Now you really gotta go so walk on by don't stop Baby leave me never see the tears I cry don't stop Now you really gotta go so walk on by don't stop Baby leave me never see the tears I cry don't stop Now you really gotta go so walk on by don't stop Baby leave me never see the tears I cry don't stop
