What would it take To turn your heart my way To move you with each word that I say 'Cause I just want to learn And I just want to know I just want to hold you baby forever Chances like these are seldom and few And this is one chance I'm not going to lose So forgive my emotions for speaking out loud But every time you're around I won't say Whatever you want Just say the words I'd buy you the stars For whatever they're worth To spell out this love across the universe I'll do whatever you want You can swear upon this love For whatever you want Just one kiss Would seal our fate Just one chance is all it takes So open your soul And let me in It's up to you baby To let this love begin You're the dream I've been waiting for In a world where dreams are fleeting Your love is a miracle That my soul been needing Whatever you whatever you want Whatever you whatever you want Whatever you whatever you want For whatever you want
