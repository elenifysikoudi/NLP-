I stare at the window wondering why It feel like you left in the dark The fi ness fight are tearing us apart But running away won't solve any problem As long as you still do care Baby don't you leave me standing here Together we'll find a way I know it ain't easy now But we'll make it through somehow Just know that my feelings are true No matter how deep we fall Together we standing tall We better for me and you I want you to know I'll give my best to you So don't you ever give up Girl you're my destiny Need you to stay with me forever and more You're asking in constantly for advices They're telling you what you should do But they don't know the darkness we've been through Now we're in a crossroad but we know where to go So baby don't take the wrong turn Can we try destiny without you by my side oh no No ones as good good as you And there ain't nobody else That makes me feel so true So never let go no never let go I wanna share my life with you girl Forever and more Forever and more I know it ain't easy now But we'll make it through somehow Just know that my feelings are true No matter how deep we fall Together we standing tall We better for me and you I want you to know I'll give my best to you So don't you ever give up Girl you're my destiny Need you to stay with me forever and more
