Some days I wanna and some days I don't Sometimes I can feel it and suddenly its gone Some days I can tell you the truth and some days I just don't Only a change of mood sun goes down someone says something too quick or too soon A touch not made one made too late army's of words can not hope to contain Then it comes and it goes And I have no control Some days I can think clear and some days I wont Sometimes I can feel it and suddenly its gone Some days I am strong and some days my skin's broken and thin That's when it feels and it takes what it needs and it leaves before I get to know Its only a step away moments that army's of words can not hope to contain Then it comes and it goes And I cant make it home And there's nothing at home And it breaks me when it goes Some days I wanna and some days I don't Sometimes I can feel it and suddenly its gone Some days I can tell you the truth and some days I just don't Only a change of mood dream comes out someone does something too quick or too soon A move not made one made too late army's of words can not hope to contain Then it comes and it goes And I seem to hope And there's nothing at home And it breaks me when it goes
