if I thought that you could stand I wouldn't hold you like I do if I thought that I could live my life with someone else than you as you turned your head to listen to what I could never say in a moment of regret I almost gave it all away that I need you to love myself that I need you to be strong I'll do anything to make this disappear I'll do anything not to be here if I thought that I could stay I wouldn't leave you like I do if I thought that in a million days just one we'd make it through and every morning as you whisper I must never let you go I would give away my life if only I could let you know that I need you to love myself that I need you to be strong I'll do anything to make this disappear I'll do anything not to be here
