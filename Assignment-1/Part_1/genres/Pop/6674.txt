Verse I realize that love is blind Sometimes we close our eyes And when we look we hope to find Someone who's there to change my life Take a wrong and make it right So I promise you a love that's true For all your life Chorus Baby I do I will I can love you for all time You're in my heart my soul And I pray that you'll be mine Baby I do If you Will take my hand and love me I can't wait to spend my life with you Verse A better man I hope to be Whenever I'm with you I know that you will always be The one who's there to share my life Till the end of time Baby I need to know You feel it's right Chorus I know that I can love you right And through the years I'll cherish Every moment with you Baby I do I will I can love you for all time You're in my heart my soul And I pray that you'll be mine Baby I do If you Will take my hand and love me I can't wait to spend my life with you I can't wait to spend my life With you
