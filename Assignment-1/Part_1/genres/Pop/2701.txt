"the shattering of old illusions created new surges of chaos no longer driven by ancient hungers I grabbed the poisened chalice clawing at the churning night thus rose my cosmic ambitions riding the snake in divine rebellion wandering the nebular centuries the precious ones brought the planetary elements apart leading the universe towards new and possessive aeons these toughs and emotions equaled the night revealed in the starborn cataclysmic attributes like monuments of unaging intellect seeking the sight in shining dreamlike presence the shattering of old illusions created new surges of chaos no longer driven by ancient hungers I grabbed the poisened chalice ""the paradox of the paragons are many side by side entangled in the complete"" dancing on the surface of devilish laments I tore apart the world's fabric of rational beliefs drawn inside a mirage in wich I will drown how simple I alone could end all those dreams majesty the last of dragons carried my faith dancing on the surface of devilish laments I tore apart the world's fabric of rational beliefs drawn inside a mirage in wich I might drown how simple I alone could end all those dreams"
