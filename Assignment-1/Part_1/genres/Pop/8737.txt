Four in the morning heart on my sleeve In your eyes possibilities I confess this is new to me But maybe this is love I got to know that this thing is real That your feeling's just what I feel No more room in this heart to steal You know it's hard enough In the morning when I wake up You're the first thing that I think of And I can make it through anything Knowing that I've got u In the morning when I wake up Nothing else can take the place of you And I know this sounds crazy But I don't know where this is I don't know what I'm in I can't see down the road But it don't matter long as I got u This life could get too hard There's so much that I can lose But it don't matter long as I got u Long as I got u Heart beats so fast I just can't keep up You pull on me like a drug I'll never go cold 'Cause I don't wanna give you up Some people search their whole life To find what I found now I'm out of time gotta tell you what's on my mind And pray that it's enough In the morning when I wake up You're the first thing that I think of And I can make it through anything Knowing that I've got u In the morning when I wake up Nothing else can take the place of you And I know this sounds crazy But I don't know where this is I don't know what I'm in I can't see down the road But it don't matter long as I got u This life could get too hard There's so much that I can lose But it don't matter long as I got u Long as I got u Think about it We fit like a puzzle no missing pieces Never doubt it I'm writing a story you know Look around it It's happening Natural as can be Since I found it I'm not gonna let it go let it go I don't know where this is I don't know what I'm in I can't see down the road But it don't matter long as I got u This life could get too hard There's so much that I can lose But it don't matter long as I got u I don't know where this is I don't know what I'm in I can't see down the road But it don't matter long as I got u This life could get too hard There's so much that I can lose But it don't matter long as I got u Long as I got u As long as I got u now
