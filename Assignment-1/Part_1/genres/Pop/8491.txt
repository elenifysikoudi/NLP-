"When good girls gone bad they gone forever But if she goin with me than she goin for better Me without you that's the longest never Living like sunshine man we on forever yup Hey man I've learned my lesson Got a good girl count your blessings Instead of spending them up on sex And good girls don't grow on trees B I G I was out in the world just messin' With the bad girls getting refreshed and Got a call from my girl Just left saying good girls don't grow on trees I felt like it was yesterday The times we had that went away We're still young but of course we felt a lot Now I've been living like a villainess been shot I met her through a friend of mine Who told me that this girl was fine I picked her up and I started to figure out There's more on the inside than on the out What she say what she say She said don't bother me hey hey She told me that I had to leave I wanted her just to believe Hey man I've learned my lesson Got a good girl count your blessings Instead of spending them up on sex And good girls don't grow on trees I was out in the world just messin' With the bad girls getting refreshed and Got a call from my girl Just left good girls don't grow on trees Helped me get my world in tact She had my heart I told her that Now it hurts every time I think about The very night that I started with acting out The morning brought a painful sun Knowing now just what I've done She always was the better half for sure The part of me in life that I preferred I gave up all of me hey hey Though I tore her up inside We still kept the love alive Amen Hey man I've learned my lesson Got a good girl count your blessings Instead of spending them up on sex And good girls don't grow on trees I was out in the world just messin' With the bad girls getting refreshed and Got a call from my girl Just left good girls don't grow on trees Woah she's like a diamond out the rough You know the good girls tainted by the bad world The good girls hard to find Woah she's like H2O can't get enough Where are the good girls tainted by the bad world Hey yo OK Look top floor of the hotel suite So connected that you know I got a motel cheap I'm saying I know I don't deserve the Noble Peace But damn I don't deserve the ""Go to hell"" speech Don't believe everything you see up in a photo When I'm with you I wish that time could move slow mo The day I met your granny I dreamed about our family And maybe one day we'll turn that group into a photo When good girls gone bad they gone forever But if she goin with me than she goin for better Me without you that's the longest never Living like sunshine man we on forever Amen I've learned my lesson Got a good girl count your blessings Instead of spending them up on sexing Good girls don't grow on trees I was out in the world just messing With the bad girls getting refreshed and Got a call from a girl just left Good girls don't grow on trees Yeah yeah yeah If you meet a good girl what you gonna do Cris Take her home take her home take her home If you meet a good girl what you gonna man Take her home take her home take her home If you meet a good girl what you gonna do Cris Take her home take her home take her home"
