They say I'm trouble They say I'm bad They say I'm evil And that makes me glad A dirty no good Down to the bone Your worst nightmare Can't take me home So I've got some mischief In my blood Can you blame me I never got no love They think I'm callous A low life hood I feel so useless Misunderstood Mirror mirror on the wall Who's the baddest of them all Welcome to my wicked world wicked world I'm rotten to the core core Rotten to the core I'm rotten to the core core Who could ask for more I'm nothing like the kid next like the kid next door I'm rotten to the I'm rotten to the I'm rotten to the core Call me a schemer Call me a freak How can you say that I'm just unique What me a traitor Ain't got your back Are we not friends What's up with that So I'm a misfit So I'm a flirt I broke your heart I made you hurt The past is past Forgive forget The truth is You ain't seen nothing yet Mirror mirror on the wall Who's the baddest of them all Welcome to my wicked world wicked world I'm rotten to the core core Rotten to the core I'm rotten to the core core Who could ask for more I'm nothing like the kid next like the kid next door I'm rotten to the I'm rotten to the I'm rotten to the core
