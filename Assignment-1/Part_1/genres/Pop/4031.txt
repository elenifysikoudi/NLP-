'Bout a month ago I've never seen your face I've never heard your voice Bout a month ago I'm a careful hunter and I have to say Before I found your love Bout a month ago Are you my boy or the flowerstand man You bought such color to this place Are you my boy or the flowerstand man With you I'm laid back I don't care if every river runs so dry I don't care if every species were to die I don't care about the ozone layer I wouldn`t notice if it wasn`t there oh no I don't care if we sell coke to Africa I don't care about apartheid I wouldn't notice if it all get better I don't care about the starving who've died
