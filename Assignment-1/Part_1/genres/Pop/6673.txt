You don't have to hurt me no more You've done quite fine my love Left my heart here on the floor You don't have to worry no more Cause I understand that you Know in your heart that we are through It's been so long since I Looked in our eye's and knew you How did it come to this when a love so rich Can hurt you so bad I know that you you feel it too Cause there's nothing left but goodbye Please say goodbye You don't have to hurt me no more You've done quite fine my love Left my heart here on the floor You don't have to worry no more Cause I understand that you Know in your heart that we are through It's just so hard for me To find the strength To get through this Sometimes I play this game And I call your name hoping that you hear my cries How could it be No you and me Now there's nothing left but Goodbye I can't say Goodbye You don't have to hurt me no more You've done quite fine my love Left my heart here on the floor You don't have to worry no more Cause I understand that you Know in your heart that we are through This crazy word Goodbye Can make you laugh and make you cry And it broke my heart in two Hearing it from you
