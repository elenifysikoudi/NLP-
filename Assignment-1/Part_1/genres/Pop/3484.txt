He had been untrue I had learned of all his lies I took a look in her eyes and she caught me by surprise I threw his shit on the floor She rushed me out of the door He tried to explain I didn't do anything I knew that he was bad Never knew just what he had I guess I don't have a life But I'll find one soon in time Started crying my eyes out I wish we never met I never had a regret I had it up to here I can't take this anymore She's this crazy now There's no telling what's in store Maybe I should start a life with someone new And give up all my hopes for I went on a drive And he caught me by surprise I took a look in her eyes And said I need you in my life I'm in love with him I'm in love with her You gotta give me the chance
