"""Christmas Holiday"" Craig Smith Hear the bells ringing Their ting a ling sound See the fresh snow It's white on the ground Hang up the stockings and Let's have a holiday today Bring out the holly we mustn't delay 'Cause all of our friends will be stopping today Warm the hot chocolate And bring out the marshmallow tray This year we shall know a wonderful Christmas And the glow of candlelight Let's have a fling I'll give you my present a wedding ring Hear me sing Turkey's a cookin and candy cane sticks With reindeer and sleigh bells and good old Saint Nick Two kids sneakin kisses beneath all the mistletoe As if we didn't know This year we shall know a wonderful Christmas And the glow of candlelight Let's have a fling I'll give you my present a wedding ring Hear me sing Yuletide good cheer Christmas is here This one we'll share We haven't a care It's Christmas Such a very Merry Christmas Extraordinary Christmastime is here "
