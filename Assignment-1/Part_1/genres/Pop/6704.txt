From the very first moment that I looked in your eyes Baby what can I say I've been lost in a daze I never thought I'd find a love like this till you came my way Though I hoped and I prayed that I'd find you someday 'Cause you opened my heart This precious gift of love I'm thankful for you every day I'm crazy over you tell me what am I supposed to do Fallin head right over heels lose my mind when I'm with you I've been walkin on cloud nine thinkin about you all the time I'm a fool in love oh yeah ain't no doubt about it Never been more sure of anything in my life You know I'll always be there I'm gonna love you forever baby Let's talk about tomorrow and the rest of our lives Till the end of time I'm gonna stand by your side 'Cause you've opened up my heart This precious gift of love I'm thankful for you every day I'm crazy over you tell me what am I supposed to do Fallin head right over heels lose my mind when I'm with you I've been walkin on cloud nine thinkin about you all the time I'm a fool in love oh yeah ain't no doubt about it No doubt when your lips are touchin mine No doubt when you look into my eyes No doubt I just want to be with you Ain't no doubt I'm crazy over you tell me what am I supposed to do Fallin head right over heels lose my mind when I'm with you I've been walkin on cloud nine thinkin about you all the time I'm a fool in love oh yeah ain't no doubt about it
