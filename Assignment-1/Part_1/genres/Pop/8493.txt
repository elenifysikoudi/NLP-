She walked into the frame She moved like water Before I know her name I want her again Now every other night we spend together And all I want to do is give her pleasure yeah And when I'm at her heart she's going down I'm shaking up when she's not around It makes me when I'm at the door I got to let her know I feel the same A girl like you shouldn't be playing those things I wanna show you more Give you all I've got She loves me so she loves me not I got to let her know I feel the same A girl like you shouldn't be playing those things I wanna show you more Give you all I've got She loves me so she loves me not I watch her sleep just like an angel But when she wakes she leaves right out there I know I'm playing in the danger But I like the things she does to me yeah I got to let her know I feel the same A girl like you shouldn't be playing those things I wanna show you more Give you all I've got She loves me so she loves me not I got to let her know I feel the same A girl like you shouldn't be playing those things I wanna show you more Give you all I've got She loves me so she loves me not But when I'm at her heart she's going down She loves me not But I'm at her heart she's going down She loves me not I got to let her know I feel the same A girl like you shouldn't be playing those things I wanna show you more Give you all I've got She loves me so she loves me not I got to let her know I feel the same A girl like you shouldn't be playing those things I wanna show you more Give you all I've got She loves me so she loves me not
