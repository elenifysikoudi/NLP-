Monochrome reflections climbing up the walls Down below your radar things are going on All along the tunnels through the underground We prepare for leaving waiting for the moon Beats above your highness coded to be safe Round and round in circles we are coming out Dance away the meters through the muddy waters We are submariners close to foreign shores Pride in sleepy hollows doesn't make us happy We are modern prophets amplified by you Scientific networks spies behind the curtain We defend the future and give it back to you Break the loop of habit time for your return Back among the living welcome and goodbye Birds in little cages all believe in freedom We provide solutions for a better living We command the system calling all receivers We are noisy people for a better living We command the system calling all receivers We are noisy people for a better living We command the system calling all receivers We are noisy people for a better living We command the system calling all receivers We are noisy people for a better living
