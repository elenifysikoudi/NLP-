I saw you coming miles away Stormy weather heard them say Turn around youre playing with fire fire fire Going faster leaving crown Sky above looking down In your arms I wanna go higher higher higher All I want I want I want I want I want I want All I want is you you All I want is you you All I want is you you All I want is you All I want is you All I want is you you All I want is you you All I want is you you All I want is you All I want is you I cant remember my life before A day without you imossible Pull me in into your river river river Slipping under youre in control Take my heart take it all all Youre making me shiver shiver shiver All I want is you you All I want is you you All I want is you you All I want is you All I want is you All I want is you you All I want is you you All I want is you you All I want is you All I want is you Cause all I want is you is you O o oh All I want is O o oh All I want is you All I want is you All I want is you you All I want is you you All I want is you you All I want is you All I want is you All I want is you you All I want is you you All I want is you you All I want is you All I want is you
