When you wish upon a star Makes no difference who you are Anything your heart desires will come to you If your heart is in your dream No request is too extreme When you wish upon a star As dreamers do Fate is kind She brings to those who love The sweet fulfillment of your secret longing Like a bolt out of the blue Fate steps in and pulls you through When you wish upon a star Your dreams come true Fate is kind She brings to those who love The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing When you wish upon a star Makes no difference who you are Anything your heart desires will come to you May all your dreams come true
