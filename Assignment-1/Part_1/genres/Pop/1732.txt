Oh my love is like a red red rose That's newly sprung in June Oh my love is like a melody That's sweetly played in tune As fair art thou my bonnie lass So deep in love am I And I will love thee still my dear Till all the seas gang dry Till all the seas gang dry my dear Till all the seas gang dry And I will love thee still my dear Till all the seas gang dry 'Til all the seas gang dry my my dear And the rocks melt with the sun And I will love thee still my dear While the sands of life shall run But faretheewell my only love Oh faretheewell a while And I will come again my love Tho 't were ten thousand mile Tho 't were ten thousand mile my love Tho 't were ten thousand mile And I will come again my love Tho 't were ten thousand mile
