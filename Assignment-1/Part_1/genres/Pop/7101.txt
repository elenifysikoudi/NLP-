You know that feeling Bright red and seizing Every word that you said Did you mean it Did you mean it all There it goes to my head You be careful It's contagious boy But it feels so good It's just wires Smoke and mirrors and flowers Help And throw me a rope I think I'm drowning Shallow people Help I think I'm falling falling again You know that feeling Bright red and seizing When you'd like to be seen Did you see her Did you see her hair Would you like to told You look gorgeous simply gorgeous We like to be heard Did you hear her Did she say something charming Help And throw me a rope I think I'm drowning Help I think I'm falling falling again Breathe in Breathe out And sigh And sigh Help And throw me a rope I think I'm drowning drowning Face down Help Oh help No more falling for tall tales again Still falling for shallow people Help Help I think I'm falling again You know the feeling Time to believe it
