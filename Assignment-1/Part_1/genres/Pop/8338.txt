The dark's chasing you cause you to think life's untrue light never reached this far becoming who you are Painting maps on your wrists the unforgetable exists all this time waiting for change the rain's still pouring all the same Again you shake again you break your life feels like misery and bleeding a luxury You are so filled of fear every person every eye stare but they'll never see through the walls built around you So tired and so weak whisper scream and speak words is just a symbol of the dream of a life above Again you shake again you break your life feels like misery and bleeding a luxury You're not gonna make it this way you can't leave can't run away a life in pieces waiting clear a burden you can't bear Again you shake again you break your life feels like misery and bleeding a luxury
