They lie on the sofa He's got his hand inside her dress He says he adores her The word is she's crazy She likes the taste between her legs They say she's a goer The truth is it bores her She's bored she's bored beyond belief There's nothing to do here She's been there She's done it She's seen it all It's taken place inside her head When no one can go there She's saving up for something She says she's up for sale Running in the shadows From the voices and the pain Nothing in the world is gonna save you Standing on the corner On the sidewalk On the game I can't ever reach you Aloha lolita I've got to have you have you He wrote in his letter Another admirer who had his way a way with words He sleeps with her picture She's saving up for something She says she's up for sale Running in the shadows From the voices and the pain Nothing in the world is gonna save you Standing on the corner On the sidewalk On the game I can't ever reach you Where would you go now If I could take you with me Run from this world and find another Come run another with me
