How did you get here When and where did he come from Girl I don't even care anymore All that I know is I'm never gonna let you go Chorus I can't remeber life before you And I can't imagine life without you And I wouldn't want a life after you There's no you I don't have any Reason to live at all Since you've walked in my life The warmth from your heart brought my love alive And I know that I will never love this way again I hope and I pray That this feeling never goes away Chorus You stole my heart the day I laid my eyes on your face And your love does something special to me No one else has ever moved me quite like you do My heart belongs to you Chorus
