Like an ordinary like an ordinary thought That drifts into a naked eye How extraordinary things are happening Can't stop myself I'm sinking into broken ice I've a head that burns Can I hold my head up There's a storm around me Love its violence a fever rush A push a shove inside Do I want to do what I do I want to loosen the noose And take a tumble as I roll the dice I've a head that burns And I hold my head up high because I can And if I drive myself distracted That is just the way I am If it pleases me to waste may time Then try to understand If I lose myself in what I do That's just because I can Like a tidal wave I'm coming close To knowing what I am Are you turning corners are you coming closer Close enough to take you for a ride Do you ever do what you fear You ever lived for the thrill Enough to fill you up inside I've a head that burns And I hold my head up high bacause I can And if I drive myself distracted That is just the way i am If it pleases me to waste may time Then try to understand If I lose myself in what I do That's just because I can Like a tidal wave I'm coming close To knowing what I am
