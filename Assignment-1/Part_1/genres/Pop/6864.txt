I'll follow the boys wherever they go I'll follow the boys cause in my heart I know I know that somewhere somewhere along the way I'll find my love my own true love someday And there'll be no place too far no ocean too wide Wherever he goes I'll be right by his side I'll follow the boys and wait until the time Till that boy that I'm following is mine There'll be no place too far no ocean too wide Wherever he goes I'll be right by his side So I'll follow the boys and wait until the time Till that wonderful boy that I'm following is mine
