Whose heart are you breaking tonight Who's kissing and holding you tight Who's looking in your eyes and sighing helplessly Who's listening to your lies those lies you told to me I can't help but wonder somehow Who's playing the fool for you now While sleeping or waking while my heart is aching Whose heart are you breaking tonight I can't help but wonder somehow Who's playing the fool for you now While sleeping or waking while my heart is aching Whose heart are you breaking tonight
