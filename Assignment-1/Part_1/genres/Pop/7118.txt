All I need is a bitter song to make me better Much better All I need to write is a bitter song to make me better Much better Mmmm Mmmm Mmm Mmmmm mmmm mmmm It found me to hold me but I don't like it at all Won't feed it won't grow it it's folded in my stomach It's not fair I found love It made me say that Get Back you'll never see daylight If I'm not strong it just might All I need is a bitter song to make me better Much better All I need to write is a bitter song to make me better I feel better I feel better
