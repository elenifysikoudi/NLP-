I can hardly make you mine Tell it to you all the time At the end of a long day And when I wake If you could just give me a sign We can leave it all behind Stop taking the long way Before we break I don't think I can make it I know you're the one Staring into the tears Like a loaded gun Well I can hardly make you mine Tell it to you all the time But you never wanted What you had to take So I can barely keep you up I guess this is just a crush Before the end of a long day And when I wake Well I know you're not the one and the only But we both know what it's like to be lonely Well these fantasies they left us wanting But just bring all your love back to me I guess for now it's just how it will be I don't think I can make it I know you're the one Staring into the tears Like a loaded gun I don't think I can make it I know you're the one Staring into the tears Like a loaded gun
