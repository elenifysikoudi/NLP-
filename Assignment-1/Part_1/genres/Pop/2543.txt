Be the winner you always were Don't you don't you dare lose Be the humble girl you are Don't cry in stranger's cars La La goodnight I'm awake and I've been losing sleep I've been fighting all my demons I've been getting weak 'Cause I've been trying trying trying To be anything other than me Be the star you know you are Don't you Don't you dare fail You can own that balance beam Two steps forward towards make believe La La Goodnight I'm awake and I've been losing sleep I've been fighting all my demons I've been getting weak 'Cause I've been trying trying trying To be anything other than me
