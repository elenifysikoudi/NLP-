VERSE 1 You're my true north when I'm headed south my constant solid ground you are my lantern in the night I'm twisted up I'm shaken you're the one I put my faith in yeah you're the reason I survive CHORUS You keep me steady when the sky is falling I keep steady after you I'll carry on when my strength is failing take heart cause you're with me so let the stars drop whatever comes I'll be ready you keep me steady 2x VERSE 2 You're a river you cover me when the bombs fall you're the cavalry yeah somehow you're always standing right by my side so no matter what I will be facing I will not be overtaken and you are the only reason why CHORUS BRIDGE You're my heart and grace my home and fear cannot invade these four walls I need you near I need you here CHORUS ENDING 'Cause you keep me steady Yeah you keep me steady You keep me steady 2x
