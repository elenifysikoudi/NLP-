My my Lagan love My Lagan love Where Lagan stream sing lullaby There blows a lily fair The twilight gleam is in her eyes The night is on her hair And like a lovesick lenanshee She hath my heart in thrall No life I own no liberty For love is lord of all My Lagan love And sometimes when the beetle horn Hath lulled the eve to sleep I steal unto her shieling low And through the dooreen peep There on the cricket's singing stone She stirs the bogwood fire And hums in soft sweet undertones The song of heart's desire The song of heart's desire
