Her eyes tell a story That she's been through many wars And the lines that are upon her face Tell you she can't take no more A shadow of her former self That is all I see And the beauty that she once possessed Is now only skin deep Leading a lonely life And she doesn't know where she's going she just doesn't know She says that now is the time But she doesn't realise That the years have passed her by There she goes She's not the girl that I once used to know There she goes What happened to the girl with the golden glow Na na na na na na na na Na na na na na na Na na na na na na na na Na na na Make no plans For tomorrow She's living for today She feels there is no future And that's a crying shame She's not the girl I used to know Her eyes no longer shine It's the life that she's been living She's been through hard times
