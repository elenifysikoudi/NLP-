I heard there was a secret chord That David played and it pleased the Lord But you don't really care for music do you Well it goes like this The fourth the fifth The minor fall the major lift The baffled king composing Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Well your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you She tied you to her kitchen chair And she broke your throne and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Maybe there's a God above But all I've ever learned from love Was how to shoot somebody who out drew you It's not a cry that you hear at night It's not someone who has seen the light It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
