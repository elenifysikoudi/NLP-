Illuminating lights under my skin Radiation so intoxicating burning within Feel the heat slowly rising The beat that's hypnotizing A wonder can you feel it Fire that's so contagious It's taking over me And you can't stop it Oh oh Turn the lights down so we can Glow glow Watch us come alive We're gonna Show you something real Like a city on a hill Oh oh We're gonna glow They see us coming from miles away There's no hiding no denying 'Cause we're not ashamed With our hands up in the air Boys and girls they start to stare It's a wonder can you feel it We will not be silent Won't hide it The time is now And you can't stop it Oh oh here we go Welcome to the show Lights shining so blinding From our head to our toes When this room blacks out You know we will stand out So come on oh We're gonna glow Oh oh here we go Like a shooting star We'll l l l light up your heart
