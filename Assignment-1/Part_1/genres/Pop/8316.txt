One day you came and made me blue Nobody close to me just you You have the power in your eyes Me and you Today you left me far behind How could I live without you tell me now Forever waiting for your love Me and you La la la la la la la You got the sun let it shine on me can't get away don't forget my tears This is the way I feel good Give me a reason to come back to you Fire still burning inside of me Feel so alone with my shattered dreams I try so hard stronger and free Why don't you want to become what could be Lost and afraid you rely on me Open my heart wash away my fears If I am scared you'll take me to Up on a place where I can run to you If you could only believe in me there's nothing else that I can't just see Feel through the way our love will too We could be in heaven our dream will come true One day you came and made me blue Nobody close to me just you You have the power in your eyes Me and you Today you left me far behind How could I live without you tell me now Forever waiting for your love Me and you Oh baby baby It has to be love spinning me round and round Me and you Oh baby baby It has to be love baby me and you
