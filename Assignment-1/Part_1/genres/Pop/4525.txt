It was down in Chinatown that I met the opium Queen Babyface girl from Shanghai never smile and never cry She now rules the underworld down in Chinatown She runs all the opium den down in Chinatown Bring her your gold bring her your worries And when life gets a bit too dreary to stand Give a ring to the Queen of Chinatown Go down Go down To the Queen of Chinatown She'll pick you up when you're feeling down Go down Go down To the Queen of Chinatown And she'll soon blow your blues away It was down in Chinatown When I met the opium Queen Babyface girl from Shanghai never smiled and never cried When love isn't what it sounds go to Chinatown When your friends have let you down got to Chinatown When life is pain When love is sorrow And it gets more than you can possibly stand Give a ring to the Queen of Chinatown Go down Go down To the Queen of Chinatown She'll pick you up when you're feeling down Go down Go down To the Queen of Chinatown And she will blow your blues away It was down in Chinatown When I met the opium Queen Babyface girl from Shanghai never smiled and never cried Go down Go down To the Queen of Chinatown When your life gets a bit dreary When you're down When you're feeling low Give a ring to the Queen of Chinatown
