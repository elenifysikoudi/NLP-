You walk straight ahead straight ahead That was your last call You walk straight ahead straight ahead Right into the wall Look in the mirror do you like what you see Is is reality or visions of me Look in the mirror can you see through the glass The other side is apetizing in fact You walk straight ahead straight ahead Right into the wall Tell your imaginary friends to come round Are they reality or visions of us You got me doing things I don't understand I've lost control and now I'm doing headstands You walk straight ahead straight ahead That was your last call You walk straight ahead straight ahead Right into the wall Look out the window is the weather unclear We're losing height I fear collision is near It's a reminder we won't make it in time Slip on your parachute And jump where it's right You walk straight ahead Straight ahead Right into the wall Look in the mirror Do you like what you see Is is reality or visions of me Look in the mirror Can you see through the glass The other side is always hollering back You walk straight ahead Straight ahead That was your last call You walk straight ahead Straight ahead Right into the wall
