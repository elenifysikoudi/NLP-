I used to walk home all alone it used to be so sad I used to be all by myself used to be so bad Until you You came along and took me by the hand Until you You came along and said that you'd be my man Now I'm jumping up and down Spinning all around because of you Babe I'm as happy as can be and it's definitely Because of you Babe Just because of you I used to go to bed at night wishing I had a friend Someone to hold and squeeze me tight one very special friend Until you You came along and told me you would be the one Until you You came along and held me in your arms You are a dream come true And there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do Baby just for you Bop ooh woah woah Bop Bop ooh woah woah Bop ooh woah woah Bop Bop ooh woah woah Bop ooh woah woah Bop Bop ooh woah woah Bop ooh woah woah Bop Bop ooh woah woah I love you
