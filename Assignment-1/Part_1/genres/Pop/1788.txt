"The Angel Gabriel from heaven came His wings as drifted snow his eyes as flame ""All hail"" said he ""thou Holy Maiden Mary "" Most highly favoured lady Gloria ""For known a blessed mother thou shalt be All generations laud and honor thee Thy son shall be Emmanuel as seers foretold "" Most highly favoured lady Gloria Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head ""To me be as it pleaseth God "" she said ""My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name"" Most highly favoured lady Gloria Of her Emmanuel the Christ was born In Bethlehem all on a Christmas morn And lowly men throughout the world will ever say Most highly favoured lady Gloria "
