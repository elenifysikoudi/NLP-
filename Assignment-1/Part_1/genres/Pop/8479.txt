This tune's called Rihanna's Gun Wyclef Cris Cab All Handz On Deck You hear me We're the best Lock the exits You have just awaken the sleeping giants Wyclef All Handz On Deck Cris Cab Wanna talk to the girls When a woman's fed up your car gets keyed up She'll call 911 and police they show up They don't need no reason to put you in prison She gives the order Rikers Island I used to hold you in my arms Now you're holding me at arms Ticky ticky tack till they're startin the alarm Yeah there's a riot in the bedroom And I don't know if I'ma make it alive or in the tomb She shoot me one time she shoot me two times She shoot me three times she shoot me four times And that feels like I've been hit with Rihanna's gun Oh one time Oh two times Oh three times Oh four times And I never got the chance to apologize So baby girl these are two roses I picked them from your garden I'm begging for your pardon Please take me back in the morning Oh these are the roses I picked them from your garden I'm begging for your pardon Please take me back in the morning She was targeting targeting targeting my heart I know she was up to something when I saw her in the dark Her hand was on the burner and my things were in the yard My hat my shoes my clothes and my nylon string guitar I told her that I loved her but I guess it's not enough She sliced up all my tires so I had to take the bus I never would admit it so she told me we were done She said she found a paper with Stacy's number on the front She shoot me one time she shoot me two times She shoot me three times she shoot me four times And that feels like I've been hit with Rihanna's gun Oh one time Oh two times Oh three times Oh four times And I never got the chance to apologize So baby girl these are the roses I picked them from your garden I'm begging for your pardon Please take me back in the morning Oh these are the roses I picked them from your garden I'm begging for your pardon Please take me back in the morning Gal how could you ever do me this When you did shoot make you never did miss Sweet words from your damn pretty lips And you shoot up the benz and take way me drist You nuh see the gully life at stake From you sleep in a bed with the snake Get carried away by the sexy shape and me drop asleep and wake She captured me Without a fight Well baby girl It's quite alright They say two wrongs don't make it right She say why you carry roses to a gun fight And suddenly I went outta sight No guns but roses I picked them from your garden I'm begging for your pardon Please take me back in the morning Oh these are the roses I picked them from your garden I'm begging for your pardon Please take me back in the morning Rihanna's gun
