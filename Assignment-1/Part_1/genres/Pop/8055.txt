Goodbye to you My trusted friend We've known each other since we were nine or ten Together we've climbed hills and trees Learned of love and A B C's Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees Goodbye My friend It's hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air Pretty girls are ev'rywhere Think of me and I'll be there We had joy We had fun We had seasons in the sun But the hills that we climbed We're just seasons out of time Goodbye Papa Please pray for me I was the black sheep of the family You tried to teach me right from wrong Too much wine and too much song Wonder how I got along Goodbye Papa It's hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air Little children ev'rywhere When you'll see them I'll be there We had joy We had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song Like the seasons have all gone Goodbye Michelle My little one You gave me love and helped me find the sun And ev'ry time that I was down You would always come around And get my feet back on the ground Goodbye Michelle It's hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air With the flowers ev'rywhere I wish that we could both be there We had lives We had fun We had seasons in the sun But the stars we could reach We're just star fish on the beach
