You're a no good heart breaker Your a liar and your a cheat And I don't know why I let you do these things to me My friends keep tellin me That you ain't no good Whoa oh oh but they don't know That I'd leave you if I could I guess I'm all uptight And I'm stuck like glue Cause I ain't never I ain't never I ain't never no no Loved a man the way that I I love a you Some time ago I thought You would run out of fools But I was so wrong You gotta one that you'll never lose The way you treat me it's a shame How could ya hurt me so bad' Baby you know that I'm the best thing That you ever had Kiss me once again Don't ya never never say that we're through Cause I ain't never never never no no Loved a man the way that I I love you I can't sleep at night and I can't leave your body I guess I'll never be free Since you got your love in me Whoa whoa whoa 'Cause I never never loved a man
