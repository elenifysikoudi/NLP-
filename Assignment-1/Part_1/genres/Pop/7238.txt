"I was on the walk home today where I saw a freight train crash through a board walk to the sea Reminding of the way things used to be but more of you and more the way that you see things Abandon this your life is a lie and about to all cave in Abandon this you're left with a hole that your friends used to live in There's still a lot there's left to know About letting go so Hey Girl are you breaking any moulds Seems to me that you're no different from the ones that you call cold And they say Hey Girl do you think you're feeling strong because there's a seventh storey window with your name just written on it's written on Abandon ship there's a break in the bow and the water's flooding in Abandon ship take a chance with the waves before this whole thing fucking sinks Abandon this your life is a lie and about to all cave in Abandon this you're left with a hole that your friends used to live in We've seen this all before Replace me with all your unused plans your friend's bands and drunken one night stands We've seen this all before That's all that you were ever good at yeah that's all you'll ever have Hey Girl are you breaking any moulds Seems to me that you're no different from the ones that you call cold And they say Hey Girl do you think you're feeling strong because there's a seventh storey window with your name just written on it's written on Don't ever say that you are different While you're bringing down everyone you know And it's hopeless so goooooo gooo You'll never understand why your whole life is falling in on you you'll never understand it's what you say and what you put people through Don't say you're different don't say you're different ""DON'T SAY YOU'RE DIFFERENT DON'T SAY YOU'RE DIFFERENT DON'T SAY YOU'RE DIFFERENT"" DON'T SAY YOU'RE DIFFERENT"""
