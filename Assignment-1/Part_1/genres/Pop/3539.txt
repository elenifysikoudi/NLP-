on to a new phase i'm starting a new craze now i'm fighting the old way there's no turning back I swear that I'm part of a new wave breathing the new waste now the dawn of a new day beginning of the end i swear that i'm not searching for an easy way out i wanna feel it all when our worlds collide and i am standing tall and i am willing to fight i wanna feel it all when our worlds collide the smoke in the distance we could finally fix this now believe it will be okay don't walk away from here tonight it's only a feeling finally a reason and it's done it's done i swear now i'm not searching for an easy way out i wanna feel it all when our worlds collide and i am standing tall and i am willing to fight i wanna feel it all when our worlds collide finally we're starting over starting over i'll watch the world as it grew colder starting over don't let it die just open up your eyes cause this time we can make it this time we can make it don't let it die just open up your eyes cause this time we can make it this time we can make it right i'm not searching for an easy way out i wanna feel it all when our worlds collide and i am standing tall and i am willing to fight i wanna feel it all when our worlds collide
