"I love you you love me But you never say that to me I want you you want me So how come I don't believe It's in the way you kiss my face And in your every move Won't you tell me something simple like the truth Even if it isn't I love you Won't you let me know your heart And lay me down is it so hard to tell me ""It's nothing don't be stupid"" How come you always say that to me ""It's alright take it easy"" But easy is so hard to be It's in the way you brush me by The way that you make love Won't you tell me something simple like the truth Even if it isn't I love you Won't you let me know your heart And lay me down is it so hard to tell me It's not that I'm weak baby I can't take it It's not that I'm blind I can see you fake it If you only knew what I'm going through You'd find the words to whisper Or you'd find the strength to leave Tell me something simple like the truth Even if it isn't I love you Won't you let me know your heart And lay me down is it so hard to tell me Won't you tell me something simple like the truth Even if it isn't I love you Won't you let me know your heart And lay me down is it so hard to tell me Why is it so hard to tell me I watch you you're reading But baby you're so hard to read I love you you love me But you never say that to me"
