With or without you baby With or without you I want you With or without your love Te amo With or without love I need you baby I've got something in my soul I don't want to let it go I just want to let you know But it's hard for me to show This is something new for me But it's where I wanna be It's another kind of world `Cause I know that I'm in love Uuuuh I want to be where I'm in love Mmm mmh I want to be where I'm in love Now you don't know what to do But you want to tell the truth Someone else belongs to you And you feel the same way too She's a beauty more than me Maybe is older I can see I don't think she's good for you She can't love you like I do I think I'm losing my mind Aah I want to be where I'm in love Oh baby I want to be where I'm in love It's so sad to stay at home Sitting by the telephone Waiting hours for your call Kick and fight against the wall It's so cold inside of me I'm so blind that I can't see That you want my love for free Is not the way it's gonna be I think I'm losing my mind With or without you baby With or without you I want you With or without your love Te amo With or without love I hate you baby
