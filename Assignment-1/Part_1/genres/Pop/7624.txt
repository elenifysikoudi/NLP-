She turned the key opened the door Was he there she wasn't sure She didn't want to fight no more She had good intentions In that moment face to face She saw the look upon his face She held him in a tight embrace There was warm affection Took a while before she spoke There were things she had to know Compose herself and she said Baby Tell me what you dream what you see Tell me how you feel oh yeah Tell me what you dream Will you share it all with me What you dream Baby you can talk to me They agreed to meet halfway They would take it day by day He didn't want to lose her twice That would cut him like a knife He decided then and there to reveal his inner fears He'd always loved her from the start It was time to give his heart Took a while before he spoke There were things he had to know Compose himself and he said Baby Tell me what you dream what you see Tell me how you feel oh yeah Tell me what you dream Will you share it all with me What you dream Baby you can talk to me Tell me what you dream What you see Tell me how you feel oh yeah Tell me what you dream what you see Tell me how you feel oh yeah Tell me what you dream Will you share it all with me What you dream Baby you can talk to me
