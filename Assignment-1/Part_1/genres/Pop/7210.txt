In and out of prison Sitting in a pit of a cell Lick the blood of the wall Razor blade love letter hell So you left me there Didn't care that they'd break down the door Were you really late Did you run away Left me to be caught Where are you now Where are you now You're supposed to be a friend of mine You're supposed to be a friend of mine In and out of trouble Pushed in a school full of fools I'm a natural animal Bent by the rules You know what I've done It's in everyone Lurking in the cold And you taught me all that I've ever known Why let me go Where are you now Where are you now You're supposed to be a friend of mine You're supposed to be a friend of mine
