It's a working man I am And I've been down underground And I swear to God If I ever see the sun Oh for any length of time I can hold it in my mind I never again Will go down underground At the age of sixteen years Oh he quarrels with his peers He vowed they'd never See another one In the dark recess of the mine Where you age before your time And the coal dust lies heavy On your lungs It's a working man I am And I've been down underground And I swear to God If I ever see the sun Oh for any length of time I can hold it in my mind I never again Will go down underground At the age of sixty four He will greet you at the door And he will gently lead you By the arm Through the dark recess of the mine He will take you back in time And he'll tell you of The hardships that were had It's a working man I am And I've been down underground And I swear to God If I ever see the sun Oh for any length of time I can hold it in my mind I never again will go down underground I never again will go down underground
