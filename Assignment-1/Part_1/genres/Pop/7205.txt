Once in a while I'll be the figure on the sleeve on the sleeve Is there anyone who understands me Oh anyone anyone anyone more than you I've played blind men's games for a vision Just to see just to see just to see how low Would you like to see how low I go Won't you see how low I go Now that it's over I'm left on the floor Cold and I'm sober It is worse than before And I hate that I want you How could I know I still love Once in a while I'll be the joker on the scene on the scene Is there anyone who cares to listen Kill the tormentor in my dream We're out in the big wide world for a mission So why do I feel inside empty and so small And I called to say Hello hello hello hello hello hello Now that it's over I'm left on the floor Cold and I'm sober It is worse than before And I hate that I want you How could I know I still love Why do I who do I why do I love you
