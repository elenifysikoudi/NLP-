I try to rise in pride I want to radiate Walk on water and ride the light I try to break to chains I want to penetrate Cross the borders and drink the oceans Give me velocity and gasoline Electricity and adrenaline I want to be superluminal I need to burn my fuel I want to detonate Melt the sun and drain the sources I need to waste my strength I want to escalate Turn the tide conquer the stars Given velocity and gasoline Electricity and adrenaline I want to be superluminal
