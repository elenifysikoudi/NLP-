I have weapons and battle plans But in my heart I know I can't ever protect you from Things I don't understand And when I hold you in my arms It scares me just to Think that something so beautiful Could just come apart in my hands I've always been chasing rainbows Staring out of classroom windows I don't think I'll ever be happy Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge I was too dumb to settle down So I packed up and I left town On a sunshine bus Wondering where it all went wrong On a flimsy wing and a prayer I followed my heart everywhere 'Til I ended up Right back where I started from I've always been quietly dreaming I don't know when I've been beaten I don't think I'll ever be happy Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge I've always been chasing rainbows Staring out of classroom windows I don't think I'll ever be happy Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge I've always been quietly dreaming I don't know when I've been beaten I don't think I'll ever be happy Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge
