I have loved and I have lived And I have had my wild romances I've taken all that life can give And taken my fair share of chances It's been a good life Far from the high life And I thank God that this is my life I've known just how it is to win And I have felt the pain of losing Some paths I chose would end in tears But they were all of my own choosing It's been a good life Far from the high life And I thank God that this is my life I've known contentment In a woman's arms And felt the warmth of her devotion And I've known heartache And a dark despair That was as deep as any ocean But we get the strength to carry on And build a life of our own making We thank the Lord for each new day And for every breath that we are taking It's a good life Far from the high life And I thank God that this was my life I've known contentment In a woman's arms And felt the warmth of her devotion And I've known heartache And a dark despair That was as deep as any ocean And looking back on all the years The loves the sweetness and the sorrow Have made me what I am today And I'd do it all again tomorrow It's been a good life Far from the high life And I thank God that this was my life We can't deny life How it flies by life And I thank God that this was my life
