Like a ghost that came from an old beginning You heated up a freezing destiny But I told myself I had a chance to live a better life By loving someone new Chorus I miss the mind of the wonderful I let the icy thoughts run through me cold And no one knows I keep the pain of a broken soul Wounds that just won't heal No one knows Not even you We had a love a future we were honest But my truth held so many little lies Can't turn the page can't rearrange It's written in the sand And tide is closing in Chorus I miss the mind of the wonderful I let the icy thoughts run through me cold And no one knows I keep the pain of a broken soul Wounds that just won't heal No one knows Not even you Cold is the night Cold are my hands Cold as my heart Oohhhhhh oohhhhhh oohh oohhhhhh Oohhhhhh oohhhhhh oohhhhhh oohh Chorus I miss the mind of the wonderful I let the icy thoughts run through me cold And no one knows I keep the pain of a broken soul Wounds that just won't heal No one knows Not even you Oohhhhhh oohhhhhh oohh oohhhhhh
