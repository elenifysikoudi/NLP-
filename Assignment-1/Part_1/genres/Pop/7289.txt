I'm a little girl And I'm just trying to figure out this funny world It's so big It's got me running around I just wanna be found by You Jesus I just wanna be found by You Jesus I just wanna be found by You See I I'm not ashamed Of being small enough to fit inside Your hand Take Your cup And let Your love abound 'Cuz I just wanna be found by You Jesus I just wanna be found by You Jesus I just wanna be found by You
