Don't you want me Don't you know it's so hard to read my mind Don't you need me Don't you need me Let the music play over and over Move on up get it on run away Let the music play over and over Ease your mind and you'll be free Let the music play over and over Move on up get it on run away Let the music play over and over Ease your mind and you'll be free When you're not in the right mood All you need is to cry Mama's thinking that you're good But you feel like you're dying Can't stop your heart from beating When you're falling in love Can't you feel how your heart is beating Deep inside you Let the music play Getting out of your bedroom Starting to make up your mind Life is better without gloom Leave your sorrow behind Don't stop your heart from beating If you want to be loved Can't feel how your heart is beating Deep inside you Let the music play Don't you want me Don't you know its so hard to read my ming Don't you need me Don't you need me Let the music play over and over Let the music play over and over Ease your mind and you'll be free Let the music play
