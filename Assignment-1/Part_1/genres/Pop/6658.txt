Every day He's farther away Only the skies above him Watching him fly With a gleam in his eye Wouldn't you love to love him I know It's not safe too near the sun But I go And keep getting closer to that light I think I might CHORUS Not today maybe not tomorrow Everything in time Have it all But do you recall Back when our minds were so free We could get close To our visions and hopes I lived for times just like these And I know What you need what you want so many things So I'll go And keep getting stronger on the way CHORUS Not today maybe not tomorrow Everything in time I am here for joy I am here for sorrow There is a reason and a rhyme It does not matter who's to blame Any judgment is blind Past the anger beyond the shame There is peace of mind In time And I know It's not safe too near the sun But I go And keep getting closer to that light I think I might CHORUS 2 Raindance Vigoda Gruber 1993 Whatcha do whatcha do with the fire Whatcha do whatcha do with the higher love I can hear them calling So close I can almost taste it Worth all the wasted time I spent wishing and falling Now I see through the hurricane's eye As the water rushes over the shoreline The waves are gonna rise and rise Claiming all that is mine CHORUS The rain is coming I will give myself up The rain is coming I will not rage inside The rain is coming turn my face to the sky Let sadness let sadness wash away I can hear I can hear the thunder I can see the lightning flash But I will not lay low 'Cause when the storm is over There'll be a fire in the sky And it will be my rainbow Now I see through the hurricane's eye As the water rushes over the shoreline The waves are gonna rise and rise Claiming all that is mine CHORUS 3 Inhabit My Heart Vigoda 1993 Dedicated to the memory of Joan Collier I cannot go where you're going Still I'll be where you are Take my hand and I will never give up hope You inhabit my heart I am a part of the night sky And you a bright morning star I look at you and I see everything so clearly You inhabit my heart Oh loving you was easy Into your radiance I fell Oh now you can run freely Into the light you love so well The tears run red down this mountain Like a faint crimson scar It is the life that you have carved into my soul You inhabit my heart Oh loving you was easy Into your radiance I fell Oh now you will run freely Into the light you love so well I cannot go where you're going Still I'll be where you are Take my hand and I will never give up hope You inhabit my heart 4 Home Vigoda 1993 I am holding something precious It is mine but not my own When I'm lonely I hold it gently And I know I'm not alone Ever changing we are becoming Something we have yet to see And as I wander ever farther I keep it here with me And I am home I am holding something fragile Breaks easy as the day But what it feels like is strong and steady Reaching me from worlds away And I am home Ever changing we are becoming Something we have yet to see And as I wander ever farther I know you're here with me And I am home 5 Once Was The Night Vigoda 1993 You were an echo in my mind The point where every winding road unwinds You wrote the code I thought was true then broke it unbeknownst to me or you And in between your magic words The echo and the call were never heard PRECHORUS And the lines are drawn A match divided and thrown As the heart holds on To the life that is known CHORUS Now what once was the night I can't seem to recognize Stars fallen from your eyes That once shone so bright I thought I could fight But now I am standing by Watching the empty sky That once was the night I couldn't tell the difference anymore What part was love and what had come before Our hands were pressed against the day That one of us would want to run away As separate as black from blue And easy as a hundred years of solitude PRECHORUS CHORUS The night so lonely A heart so black so blue I know the morning can only Reveal the shadows of you I was going nowhere fast And every step would take me toward the past I began to shrink inside So small that when my lonely knot was tied I was an echo in your mind Lost in canyons I would never find PRECHORUS CHORUS 6 Illyria Vigoda Kendrick 1993 7 Tempt Me Vigoda 1991 Each time I walk to that open door I know it isn't right Too long this heart has been spoken for Gonna give it up give it up tonight I remember how it might have been All I want is just to feel it again CHORUS Tempt me show me what I'm missing won't you Tell me cause you know I'm gonna listen Tantalize me with the fruit of your tree Tempt me Tempt me Each time you smile as you walk on by And I know it must be right Too long this heart's been dissatisfied Gonna live it up live it up tonight I remember how it might have been All I want is just to feel it again CHORUS 8 Evolution Turning Vigoda 1993 I don't want to talk about the future My mind is overflowing right here right now And I have had enough surprises for awhile Close your eyes and listen to the peaceful All I want is to hold this moment in my hand Catch it before it slips through like the sand CHORUS It's hard to make time stand still The more that you hold on the faster it flies It's hard for us to get our fill But we write and we drink and we look for love And we try Ask me what do I believe in A faded picture and a melody All that lingers from when he was here with me Every dancer With every revolution Shows the answer Is in the evolution Turning spinning moving on I don't want to talk about the future 'Cause every day just races by so fast Never waiting for me To learn the lessons of the past 9 Lightning And The Tree Vigoda Kendrick 1993 I never meant you any harm Said the lightning to the tree I only saw what I was seeking What I was made to see I cannot change What I don't understand And I was never taught To look again You know I never meant to hurt you Said the blizzard to the deer I only reveled in my power Did not recognize your fear I cannot change What I don't understand And I was never taught To look again I never meant to hurt you Said the husband to the wife I only see that I am destined To relive my father's life Look again Look again Look again 10 Phantom Lover Vigoda Gruber 1993 I've got one foot on the altar and the other on the ground Safe in the daylight sun I've got one hand to hold you and the other slams you down These things I've done Sometimes I feel like you see right through me You hear all my fears breathing on the midnight breeze like Phantom lovers Am I just your Phantom lover There's sunlight all around you and the ghost inside my heart It chills my soul Sometimes I feel like you see right through me You hear all my fears breathing on the midnight breeze like Phantom lovers Am I just your Phantom lover 11 Patiently Vigoda 1990 It was so easy To be your lover and your friend And when I hear your voice It all comes back again You know I understand Ambition has its price But are you really sure That it's my heart you want to sacrifice PRECHORUS 'Cause I have loved you oh so long and I I just know that you still care And every day since you've been gone I I still can feel your body there CHORUS Patiently I wait for you 'Cause I know that no one else will ever do I'll see it through You'll come to me If I wait patiently My friends all tell me To leave the memories behind But I cannot forget So easily this time I have no tenderness Reserved for someone new I gave it all I gave it all to you PRECHORUS CHORUS
