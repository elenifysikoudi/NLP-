the forcing walla are closing in and the sky is still descending the price for a life in sin is beyond repair and mending he can see it in the eyes where life is slowly fading it's not worth it to be nice to a voice that's so evading he pulls the trigger of his gun the voice is so degrading petrified he tries to run the words reverberating he hears chanting choirs and voices at night they're raging like fires but speaking so light he wants to kill the past to be alone at last he takes a step into the brain little there remaining dissolving in the frozen rain the voice is disengaging he hears chanting choirs and voices at night they're raging like fires but speaking so light he wants to kill the past to be alone at last
