Electric love Electric it's electric Electric love Electric it's electric Sittin here just waiting for my cell phone to ring 'Cause I can't get you off my mind My heart is racing faster than electricity Cause I keep thinkin about that night And then when you held my hand Asked me to dance We danced under the lights Remember when you took that chance on a sweet romance Boy you got it right Cause we got that electric love Electric it's electric Electric love Electric it's electric I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'Cause I know that it's true with you Oh I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'Cause I know it's true I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'Cause I know that it's true with you Electric love Now we got this power that's between you and me Like lightning will light up the sky light up the sky If we got each other we got what we need Forever will be burnin bright Remember when you held my hand Asked me to dance We danced under the lights Remember when you took that chance on a sweet romance Boy you got it right Cause we got that electric love Electric it's electric Electric love Electric it's electric I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'Cause I know that it's true with you Oh I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'Cause I know it's true I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'Cause I know that it's true with you Electric love So tell me where you wanna where you wanna go We can fly to the moon and watch the world down below We can sail into the open we can sail into the open seas Boy if I got you I got all I need Yeah cause we got electric we got electric love Baby we got electric we got electric love Electric love Electric it's electric Electric love Electric it's electric Electric love Electric love Electric love Electric love Electric love Electric love Electric love Electric love Electric love I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'Cause I know that it's true with you Electric love Oh I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'Cause I know it's true Electric love I like how I feel when I feel what I feel 'Cause I know that it's true with you Remember we were dancing all through the night We took a chance and boy did we get it right Remember we were dancin' Remember we were dancin all through the night We took a chance and boy did we get it right Remember we were dancin all through the night We took a chance and boy did we get it right Remember we were dancin all through the night We took a chance and boy did we get it right
