I bet you think that you're the only ones That the brightest lamps all keep on burning for you You keep on leaving love a smoking gun Go on and let em talk we'll give them something to do We've got it 2x And we won't be your problem anymore We've got it 2x Oh no more There's no one else for me but you There's only you my love There's no one else that's really here There's only you my dear 2x Do you believe that what is done is done That you can come so far and never leave them a clue We've got it 2x And we won't be your problem anymore We've got it 2x Oh no more We're not here waiting up for you There's no more time for that We're not here praying just for you There's no more tears to lean on We're not here waiting up for you Just you remember that We're not here praying just for you There's no more tears to cry for you [There's no one else for me but you There's only you my love There's no one else that's really here There's only you my dear] 2x
