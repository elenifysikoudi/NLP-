There you were Standing there As your eyes reached out to me Something warm in your eyes Touched my heart right then and there All the love I never knew I found in you Suddenly My world stood still My life was then fulfilled As you gently touched my hand I knew that we had laying a plan For everlasting love That I been forever dreaming of At last oo At last My forever came today my forever came today When you walked into my life when you walked into my life And made my lonely life A paradise a paradise It came today Forever came today As we were standing there You didn't speak a single word But your eyes Your eyes said you wanted me Your touch said you needed me And my heart said tenderly Darling oo My darling Make me yours Let your kiss touch my face And tell me love has led me To this place to your warm embrace And our happiness Thanks to you my search has ended And I want the world to see How gently love has shined on me With everlasting love That I been forever dreaming of At last oo At last My forever came today my forever came today When you walked into my life when you walked into my life And made my lonely life A paradise a paradise It came today Forever came today At last oo At last My forever came today my forever came today When you walked into my life when you walked into my life And made my lonely life A paradise a paradise Oh it came today Forever came today At last At last My forever came today my forever came today When you walked into my life
