And I extend an open hand Over the horizon Waiting for the sun To fall into my palm And hide inside my fist In a foreign land Watching the sea Reaching for the sun Rising like a lover For the promised kiss Rising like a lover For the promised kiss In foreign lands Watching the sea Reaching for the sun Rising like a lover And I extend an open hand Over the horizon Waiting for the sun To fall into my palm Repeat In foreign lands Watching the sea Reaching for the sun Rising like a lover And I extend an open hand Over the horizon Waiting for the sun To fall into my palm And I extend an open hand Over the horizon Waiting for the sun To fall into my palm And hide inside my fist In a foreign land Watching the sea Reaching for the sun Rising like a lover For a promised kiss Rising like a lover For the promised kiss I am longing for all the things I'll never get I am longing for all the things I haven't lost I am longing for innocence and simple dreams I am longing for ignorance and bliss Repeat I am longing for all the things I'll never get I am longing for all the things I haven't lost I am longing for innocence and simple dreams I am longing for ignorance and bliss For ignorance and bliss
