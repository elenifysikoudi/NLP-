Once in the dear dead days beyond recall When on the world the mists began to fall Out of the dreams that rose in happy throng Low to our hearts Love sang an old sweet song And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam Softly it wove itself into our dream Just a song a twilight when the lights are low And the flickering shadows softly come and go Tho the heart be weary sad the day and long Still to us at twilight comes Love's old song Comes Love's old sweet song Even today we hear Love's song of yore Deep in our hearts it dwells forevermore Footsteps may falter weary grow the way Still we can hear it at the close of day So till the end when life's dim shadows fall Love will be found the sweetest song of all
