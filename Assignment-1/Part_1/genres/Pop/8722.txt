You turn me on Now don't turn it off Cause I don't want to fade out tonight Your lips are the sweetness Your body's the sin A single touch and my skin is electrified One kiss two hearts beat in time Here's my hello Don't say goodbye Do you want me Just stay here with me tonight Look in my eyes you can't deny me NO Here's my hello Don't say goodbye You taunt me I'll stay here waiting for you I lose my mind Here's my hello don't say goodbye Can't get a grip now I'm in too deep Give me a taste of your love Then you're gone How can I catch you and swallow you whole With a sway of your hips I lose control One kiss two hearts beat in time Here's my hello Don't say goodbye Do you want me Just stay here with me tonight Look in my eyes you can't deny me NO Here's my hello Don't say goodbye You taunt me I'll stay here waiting for you I lose my mind Here's my hello don't say goodbye Can't stop thinking about you Don't start without me We cannot proceed unless I Put a lock on the door Throw away the key Just stay here with me Under the sheets One kiss two hearts beat in time Here's my hello Don't say goodbye Do you want me Just stay here with me tonight Look in my eyes you can't deny me NO you can't deny me Here's my hello Don't say goodbye You taunt me I'll stay here waiting for you I lose my mind Here's my hello don't say goodbye Here's my hello Don't say goodbye Do you want me Just stay here with me tonight Look in my eyes you can't deny me NO Here's my hello Don't say goodbye You taunt me I'll stay here waiting for you I lose my mind Here's my hello don't say goodbye
