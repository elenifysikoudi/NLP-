Tell your story Hey yeah Listen y'all Girl I know you think that it's me you're hurtin' By denying me the right Take part in his life That ain't fare to him and it just ain't right And I know you think that I don't deserve it But for our child's sake Don't make this mistake Don't make him choose between us Remember the words that I told you yeah He's gonna resent you when he's older And trust me you don't want that kind of pain no no no He's a part of me that you know you can't deny And baby no matter how hard you try When you look at him you'll see me in his eyes It may seem right now But soon you'll find out Just who you're hurting babe Now let me see my child 'Fore its too late His heart fills with hate We've got to work it out Now let me see my child You can't tell me he don't ever ask about me Can you tell him the truth about me and you Or will you tell lies cause its easy to do You have to know that it's not a game 'Cause I'm here to stay This child bears my name My blood runs through his veins Just because you and I weren't happy Doesn't change the fact that I'm his Daddy So swallow your pride He needs me in his life See I need him as every bit as much as you So just try to put yourself in my shoes 'Cause if you were me what you do It may seem right now But soon you'll find out Just who you're hurting babe Now let me see my child 'Fore its too late His heart fills with hate We've got to work it out Now let me see my child Now I know we both have regret For the sake of that boy Lets forgive and forget And I know that its easier to fight But just look at him You have to see the thing we did right It may seem right now But soon you'll find out Just who you're hurting babe Now let me see my child 'Fore its too late His heart fills with hate We've got to work it out Now let me see my child Child let me see my child I got to see my child Your hurting him your hurting him Child he needs me in his life Child I gotta show him how to be man I gotta see him I want to see him Let me see him Child yeah I got to see him yeah oh Child let me see my child
