As we're standing here I think it's crystal clear What I want from you It's obvious that you want me too Is it dangerous For the two of us To feel this good It's the only reason why I think we should So what's in our way What's in our way The Libertines live for today For today When you're lying near My panic disappears What you've given me Changes my identity We're delirious As they envy us We're misunderstood You're the only reason why I thought I could So let's run away let's run away I wouldn't waste another day Run away
