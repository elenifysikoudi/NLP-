I have climbed highest mountains I have run through the fields Only to be with you only to be with you I have run I have crawled I have scaled these city walls These city walls only to be with you But I still haven't found What I'm looking for But I still haven't found What I'm looking for I have kissed honey lips Felt the healing fingertips Burned like a fire this burning desire I have spoke with tongue of angels I have held the hand of a devil It was warm in the night I was cold as a stone But I still haven't found What I'm looking for But I still haven't found What I'm looking for But I still haven't found What I'm looking for But I still haven't found What I'm looking for But I still haven't found What I'm looking for But I still haven't found What I'm looking for I have climbed highest mountains I have run through the fields Only to be with you only to be with you But I still haven't found What I'm looking for But I still haven't found What I'm looking for But I still haven't found What I'm looking for
