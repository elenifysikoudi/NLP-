"No one ever kissed me the way that you do And no one ever told me""I love you"" No one ever cared No no one ever shared All those dreams that I dreamed would come true No one ever hurt me the way that you do ""Cause no one ever broke my heart in two But I'll keep on caring my whole life through For no one no one but you "
