Gotta have you Working over time Does it matter If it cross the line I'm addicted Keeps me up all night I don't care if It's wrong or right Do you know does it show what I really want Do you know do you know Is it love that I feel for you Tell me what am I supposed to do Can't you see what it does to me Confusion is poisoning my mind Love is killing me Love is killing me Turn the lights down low Take it nice and slow Push your body Real close to mine Be delighted You're invited Gonna take you Higher than high Do you know does it show you what I really want Do you know do you know Is it love that I feel for you Tell me what am I supposed to do Can't you see what it does to me Confusion is poisoning my mind Confusion is poisoning my mind Love is killing me Don't you hesitate Don't you be afraid We can't go on like this Our backs against the wall This time we're gonna fall Fall in love In love Is it love that I feel for you Tell me what am I supposed to do Can't you see what it does to me Confusion is poisoning my mind Is it love that I feel for you Tell me what am I supposed to do Can't you see what it does to me Confusion is poisoning my mind Confusion is poisoning my mind Love is killing me
