"Over the ground lies a mantle white A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night Two hearts are thrilling In spite of the chilling weather Sleigh bells ring are you listening In the lane snow is glistening It's a beautiful sight we're happy tonight Walking in a winter wonderland Gone away is the bluebird Here to stay is a new bird He sings a love song as we go along Walking in a winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman Then pretend that he is Parson Brown He'll say ""Are you married "" we'll say ""No man"" But you can do the job when you're in town Later on we'll conspire As we dream by the fire To face unafraid the plans that we made Walking in a winter wonderland Love knows no season love knows no Romance can blossom any old time Here in the open we're walking and hoping Together Sleigh bells ring are you listening In the lane snow is glistening It's a beautiful sight we're happy tonight Walking in a winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman Then pretend that he is Parson Brown He'll say ""Are you married "" we'll say ""No man"" But you can do the job when you're in town Later on we'll conspire As we dream by the fire To face unafraid the plans that we made Walking in a winter wonderland To face unafraid the plans that we made Walking in a winter wonderland Mmm hmm hmm mmm hmm Walking in a winter wonderland Mmm hmm hmm mmm hmm Walking in a winter wonderland Mmm hmm hmm mmm hmm Walking in a winter wonderland"
