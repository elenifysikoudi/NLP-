It seems frail but its real solid strong of the world we build you just gotta believe outside its cold a dangerous road never dare cross it alone this envy you must seal And you should know when Im with you and youre my own my reason to live and I forget where I belong if we just believe Let it go I`ll let it go and I hope that you can understand when theres you and I nothing else matters Realize their vain disguise they throw powder in your eyes this mirage deceives you know the truth our home well choose this sanctuary is our booth pour une mort douce et tranquille
