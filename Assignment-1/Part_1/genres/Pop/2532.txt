"I said ""Don't go"" I said ""Don't leave"" But you wasted all my time Pretending you were mine It's a let down heartbreak Fast breath slow ache It ain't gettin no better than this It's a let down heartbreak Fast breath slow ache It ain't gettin no better than this So I said ""Screw it eh eh"" I said ""Hold on"" You said ""Something's wrong"" And you wasted all your lies I thought we were fine It's a let down heartbreak Fast breath slow ache It ain't gettin no better than this It's a let down heartbreak Fast breath slow ache It ain't gettin no better than this And it's been a while I'm still on fire I'm not tiring You're just a liar I'm just a buyer of your badness It's a let down heartbreak Fast breath slow ache It ain't gettin no better than this It's a let down heartbreak Fast breath slow ache It ain't gettin no better It's a let down heartbreak Fast breath slow ache It ain't gettin no better than this It's a let down heartbreak Fast breath slow ache It ain't gettin no better than this It ain't getting better better than this It ain't getting better better than this It ain't getting better better than this It ain't getting better better than this Better better than this"
