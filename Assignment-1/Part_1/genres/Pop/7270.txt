Been working overtime And gettin sick of these crazy games I'll be a satellite And wait for someone to enter my gaze I see you like a star in the sky And I love it Yeah the light in yours eyes And I wonder When you're looking in mine Do you see them Like a star in the sky You got me falling for ya And I won't stop til I hit the clouds See I don't wanna hide these feelings Or even try to figure them out Sparks flyin all around Electricity Dance with me dance with me dance with me Ten feet of the ground No gravity Fly with me fly with me
