Remember how it felt together The rain would catch us as we'd fall You ran away to something better I ran away with none at all I wish those moments last I take that promise back I wonder if you know I see how this thing goes Some say that you can't get back I know that it ain't like that So hard when I had to go but I want I wanna know I got to know I wanna know But I got to know Remember how it felt together Always waiting on your call I still gave you all my time yeah We shouldn't live in love at all I wish those moments last I take that promise back I wonder if you know I see how this thing goes Some say that you can't get back I know that it ain't like that So hard when I had to go but I want I wanna know I got to know I wanna know But I got to know Remember how it felt together The rain would chase us as we'd fall I wish those moments last I take that promise back I wonder if you know I see how this thing goes
