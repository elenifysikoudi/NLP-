"Rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose And if you ever saw him you would even say it glows All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say ""Rudolph with your nose so bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight "" Then all the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee Rudolph the red nosed reindeer you'll go down in history Frosty the Snowman Was a jolly happy soul With a corncob pipe and a button nose And two eyes made out of coal Frosty the Snowman Is a fairytale they say He was made of snow But the children know How he came to life one day There must have been some magic In that old silk hat they found For when they placed it on his head He began to dance around Frosty the Snowman Was alive as he could be And the children say He could laugh and play Just the same as you and me Frosty the Snowman Knew the sun was hot that day So he said let's run And we'll have some fun Now before I melt away Down to the village With a broomstick in his hand Running here and there all around the square Saying catch me if you can He led them down the streets of town Right to the traffic cop And he only paused a moment when He heard him holler stop Frosty the Snowman Had to hurry on his way But he waved goodbye Saying don't you cry I'll be back again some day Thumpety thump thump Thumpety thump thump Look at Frosty go Thumpety thump thump Thumpety thump thump Over the hills of snow"
