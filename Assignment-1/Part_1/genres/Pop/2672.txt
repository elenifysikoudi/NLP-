i have devils on my mind and the hour's getting late there's nothing more to have i'm waiting for the day the weeks are passing by thinking of the days i want to burn myself again i want to violate you i want you to hurt me again oh i'm never gonna to waste your time again burn your love tonight oh i'm never gonna to waste your time again we can touch the stars tonight i have devils in my mind they refuse to set me free my followers in crime but you're the one I fear hiding from your eyes thinking of your skin i want to burn myself again i want to violate you i want you to hurt me again oh i'm never gonna to waste your time again burn your love tonight oh i'm never gonna to waste your time again we can touch the stars tonight
