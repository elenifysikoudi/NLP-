If you're playing that drum but you got no rhythm If you're a little out of key but you're always singing If you're so carefree but so not careless Such a wreck but ain't love wreck less If you're listening I hope you hear this Long live the young at heart You know who you are With your spirit burning Take a risk and take a chance Carry on Long live the soul set free Don't be afraid to dream While the world's still turning Every moment make it happen With two left feet Keep on dancing Beat by beat Breath by breath Walking hand in hand Step by step With drop of faith and childlike wonder You can weather the lighting you can brave the thunder No road map but keep on running No parachute but keep on jumping Oh I think you might be onto something Beat by beat Breath by breath Walking hand in hand Step by step Here and now Day by day Won't let this memory slip away Every moment make it happen With two left feet Keep on dancing Beat by beat Breath by breath Walking hand in hand Step by step
