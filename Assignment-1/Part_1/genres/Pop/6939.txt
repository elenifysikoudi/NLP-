Like a cannonball to my chest Her words ripped me in two I wished her all of the best And she wished me the truth So what am I supposed to do Now that I've lost all I've known The heavy heart that's inside of me Is sinking like a stone Sinking like a stone Save me save me I need more than just a hand to hold I need to be carried Save me save me Bring your sweet redemption And promise to never leave Like a soldier going off to war It hurt to let him go I did what needed to be done But now I'm feeling so alone We built a home out of sand But the tide kept coming strong Broken back and calloused hands I can only stand so long Now all my hope is gone Save me save me I need more than just a hand to hold I need to be carried Save me save me Bring your sweet redemption And promise to never leave You are the place where I belong I'll never know where I went wrong Forever I am holding on To the hope of you Save me save me I need more than just a hand to hold I need to be carried Save me save me Bring your sweet redemption And promise to never leave
