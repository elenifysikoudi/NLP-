When you came in my life It was on borrowed time This is what I understood So we did all we could Made most of all our days We were happy in every way Now at night I dare not dream 'Cause when I wake you're not with me I guess I tried hard Hard to pretend That I didn't care Or even want you in the end I live in hope That you'll come back to me That you'll come back to me I live in hope That you'll come back to me That you'll come back to me Always thought that I knew What I would do When it came time for you To shoot on through my life Always thought that I'd try Try to live my life Never have you on my mind I guess I was telling lies But I tried hard Hard to pretend That I didn't care Or even want you in the end I live in hope I guess right now I hurt inside Now that you're gone But you brought so much into my life No one can mean Mean as much to me So I pray each day That you'll come back to me I live in hope
