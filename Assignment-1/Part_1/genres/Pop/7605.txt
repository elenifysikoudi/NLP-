V 1 I dont wanna talk about it It makes me wanna cry Every time I pour out my emotions I feel emptier inside I don't know how to play it like I'm not in love with you But I'll try Even though I do still Chorus Miss you Just like the air that I breathe I need you With me I'm not gonna lie I cant imagine my life With out you but I Suppose I will survive V 2 I'm not gonna play myself Every time my cell rings Checkin for your name I promise that I'll never tell You how I feel And I know that you dont feel the same Did you think that you could hurt me so I just gotta let you go Everytime I find myself alone ooooh I Chorus bridge Dont try to explain Why your love's changed Boy you really broke my heart this time I wont let it take away my pride or Who I have inside Boy I'm torn between every thing how could I feel nothing I woulda done anything If it would mean I could make you love me You're the one I need But you still believe We can never be And I miss you More than the air that I breathe I need you With me I'm not gonna lie And I can't imagine myself With out you but I suppose I will survive I'll be fine dont worry about me I'll be okay
