I'm lost to the world soon to be forgotten Living in the shadows searching for belief But my anger is gone and the anvil is broken The pieces on the ground melting in the silence I keep my head above the surface Trying to breathe Looking for land I keep an eye at the distant horizon Waiting for help Clutching the sky My fear is my cross heavy on my shoulders Learning to be patient burning to be free So my spirit is strong but my body is broken My father in the fire dying for survival
