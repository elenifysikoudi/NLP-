I really can't stay Baby it's cold outside I've got to go away Baby it's cold outside This evening has been Been hoping that you'd drop in So very nice I'll hold your hands they're just like ice My mother will start to worry Beautiful words you're humming And father will be pacing the floor Listen to the fireplace roar So really I'd better scurry Sweetheart what's you're hurry Well maybe just a half a drink more Why don't you put some records on while I pour The neighbors might think But baby it's bad out there Say what's in this drink No cabs to be had out there I wish I knew how Your eyes are like starlight now To break the spell I'll take your hat your hairs looks swell I ought to say no no no sir Mind if I move a little closer At least I'm gonna say that I tried What's the sense in hurting my pride I really can't stay Baby don't hold out Oh but it's cold outside I simply must go Baby it's cold outside The answer is no But baby it's cold out there The welcome has been How lucky that you dropped in So nice and warm Look out the window at that storm My sister will be suspicious Girl your lips look delicious My brother will be there at the door Like waves upon a tropical shore My maiden aunt's mind is vicious Oh baby you're so delicious Well maybe just a cigarette more Never such a blizzard before I got to get home Oh baby you'll freeze out there Say lend me a coat It's up to your knees out there You've really been grand I'm thrilled when you touch my hand Why don't you see How can you do this thing to me There's bound to be talk tomorrow Making my lifelong sorrow At least there will be plenty implied If you caught pneumonia and died I really can't stay Get over that hold out Ah but it's cold outside Baby it's cold outside Come on stay a little longer Okay
