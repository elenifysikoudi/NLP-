Paradise where have you gone I long so to see your shore I have to wait it makes my eyes sore Sinking more all the time Blessed by your request on high I was lied to Wrought by learning less from outside I had a right to bruise Baited and wily the moon it always opens up for me I'm lost in this mirror of sorts a warrior without words Growing cold I've traded wine for Elysium I've traded souls stone to gray I'm half aware with my mind closed thinking more all the time Blessed by my new quest on high I was lied to Taught by the Prophets from our skies I fell in to truth Baited and wily oh Luna can't you open up for me I'm lost in this mirror of sorts a warrior without war growing cold Baited and wily oh luna can't you shine the way for me I'm lost in this mirror of souls a warrior without war I am aching so wildly oh luna can't you shine the way for me I am lost in this mirror of souls I'm without words Going home Paradise where have you gone I long so to see your shore
