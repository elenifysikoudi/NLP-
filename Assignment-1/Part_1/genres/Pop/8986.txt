This is no accident This is no lucky encounter She's been standing in this spot for hours Trying to think of something good to say She thinks she might be wrong Could you just tell her the way to go If you happen to be going there too Could she maybe get a ride with you So soon she never thought that she could find another When in reality you really should take cover Here comes the heartbreak Here comes the end of days She she hopes that you can lose your faith together She needs some company when losing it forever Here comes the hollow Here comes the life she knows She needs new scenery She needs a brighter reflection Just a new excuse to stay indoors With a little time to settle scores And for the first few months You think you've never been happier How could anything as this could change How could anything be rearranged So soon she never thought that she could find another When in reality you really should take cover Here comes the heartbreak Here comes the end of days She she hopes that you can lose your faith together She needs some company when on losing it forever Here comes the hollow Here comes the life she knows The life she knows She needs some company when losing it When losing it Give her some company when losing it When losing it Oh Oh Oh Oh She needs to lose your faith together She needs to lose your faith together She needs some help to pull the trigger
