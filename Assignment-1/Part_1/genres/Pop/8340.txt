Now i'm the only one that's home surrounded by the winter cold as I think of how it would be to have you right here with me Leave the door open as I go to bed dreaming that you never said bye to me don't leave me here wherever you are I wanna be there Don't you know I miss you and all I wish to do is to run until I find where you are for you I could run so far so far The sun's gone darkness all around looking through every picture of you I found and there's beauty in every single one so I wonder how long you'll be gone Wanna watch you smile at me hold your hand feel realised spend my time with the best person I know and I won't let you go Don't you know i miss you and all I wish to do is to run until I find where you are for you I could run so far so far As I'm laying here alone realize this is no real home I wanna be with you nothing else I'd rather do Don't you know i miss you and all I wish to do is to run until I find where you are for you I could run so far so far
