Buachaill o'n Eirne me s bhreagfainn calin deas og Ni iarrfainn bo spre lei ta me fhein saibhir go leor 'S liom Corcaigh da mheid e dha thaobh a ghleanna s Tir Eoghain 'S mura n athrai me beasai s me n t oidhr ar Chontae Mhaigh Eo Come by the hills to the land where fancy is free And stand where the peaks meet the sky and the lochs meet the sea Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun And the cares of tomorrow can wait til this day is done Come by the hills to the land where life is a song And stand where the birds fill the air with their joy all day long Where the trees sway in time and even the wind sings in tune And the cares of tomorrow can wait til this day is done Come by the hills to the land where legends remain And the stories of old fill the heart and may yet come again Where the past has been lost and the future is still to be won And the cares of tomorrow can wait til this day is done
