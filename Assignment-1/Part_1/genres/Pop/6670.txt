Got this information I don want to act upon Taking advantage of the situation would be wrong All the wrong reasons I give myself away Every time you walk into the room I can hide the way I feel for you I trip over my words And end up feeling like a fool When you tell me he the one for you But you don hear him talk You don know his game His intentions and desires aren't the same Pride ego selfishness Trying to fill some emptiness Girl he making love to you For all the wrong reasons I could give him up so easily And move in with my sympathy But I don want you here with me For all the wrong reasons You trust me like a friend And tell me all the little things he does He makes you feel like youe the lucky one But secrets I can tell The way he playing you around It killing me to watch it all go down If you could read his mind See behind his eyes You know yourself His love is just a lie Chorus Got this information I don want to act upon Taking advantage of the situation would be wrong And I wish I never knew What he doing to you Chorus Out Written by Jack Kugell Steve Kipner and David Kopatz
