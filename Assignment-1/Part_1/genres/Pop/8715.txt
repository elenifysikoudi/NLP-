Not afraid when I'm with you I'm afraid when I'm without you Can you blame me for thinking this way You would know it if you saw you The way I do you should try to I never need to sell myself for you It's that type of love that you see Only up on the movie screens But we got that love you and me And it scares the life out of me But I'm not afraid when I'm with you you you no I'm afraid when I'm without you yeah And I don't know what to do do do no 'Cause I'm afraid when I'm without you Put me in a padded room cause I might go crazy I might go a little bit insane without my baby My whole world doesn't look the same I'm so afraid without you Body's shaking now I'm spinning around And it seems so hard to breathe Someone slow me down only you know how And it happens every time you leave It's that type of love that you see Only up on the movie screens But we got that love you and me And it scares the life out of me But I'm not afraid when I'm with you you you no I'm afraid when I'm without you yeah And I don't know what to do do do no 'Cause I'm afraid when I'm without you Put me in a padded room cause I might go crazy I might go a little bit insane without my baby My whole world doesn't look the same I'm so afraid without you I'm swimming in the deep end Only you can rescue me There's no need to pretend You're the missing piece of me I'm so afraid without you Not afraid when I'm with you you you no I'm afraid when I'm without you yeah And I don't know what to do do do no 'Cause I'm afraid when I'm without you Put me in a padded room cause I might go crazy I might go a little bit insane without my baby My whole world doesn't look the same I'm so afraid without you I'm so afraid without you I'm so afraid without you
