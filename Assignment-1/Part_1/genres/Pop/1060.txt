I've got nothing to worry about So I worry about nothing I think I've got fleas or some tropical disease And my spider sense is tingling I've got nothing to panic about So I panic about nothing I won't buy grapes I check the sell by dates And I only eat fruit out of tins I've got the blues I've got lifts in my shoes And I'm scared of the countryside I can't sleep cause I see spiders When I close my eyes I've got nothing to be afraid of So I'm afraid of nothing I've emptied out the cupboard underneath the stairs Because I think the sky is gonna fall in How did I get to be such a Mess so soon in my life I can't sleep cause I see spiders When I close my eyes All I ever wanted to be Was comfortable and kind I can't sleep cause I see spriders When I close my eyes I'd love to go to San Francisco But I'm too afraid to fly I can't help it I see spiders When I close my eyes
