How worn we were on such a day You can almost feel the date And I can't deny the pain So I wait for the right time To wish the world away To walk in And I can't help wanting every word To escape this night We are worn and we dress on Sunday Try to touch the smile And I can't describe your face So I wait for the next time To wish the world away And walk in And I can't help wanting every word To escape this night And with your eyes You can't help watching everywhere Before it begins You can break this silence oh with your heart Here we take this vow and you struggle Invitation to the other I will come forsake the others I'll see you again And you can't help wanting every word We can escape this night And with your arms you can't help wanting everywhere Before it begins you can break this silence with your heart
