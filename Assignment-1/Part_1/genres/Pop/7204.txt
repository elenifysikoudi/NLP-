I want to get wired on something new I want to get high on something I want to get wired on something new Every wide open space It's the gaping holes that get to you They frighten you An echo of your emptiness Every lie that you've fed You can kiss my open spaces I am safe from you I'm better now I'm better now I want to get wired on something new I want to get high on something I want to get wired on something new Every scan I've erased Leave a memory that will prey on you An overspill I hope it will I hope it will All the time I have wasted Tasted bitterness Now I confess you waste my space At any time at any rate I want to get wired on something new I want to get high on something I want to get wired on something new Now you're up against a wall It's the other side that scares you And you're groping through the hole And you're hoping for a way out Your strength is on it's last legs You could be somewhere else Instead you're blinded by the way out The way out And it's right here I want to get wired on something new I want to get high on something I want to get wired on something new I want to get high on something I want to get high on something
