You alone you alone Are the dream I have known Bringing love to my lonely heart Now there's heaven in view Now the dream has come true For tonight I have you alone Now that your eyes have told me You are my love my own Come to my arms and hold me I live for you alone Solo tu solo tu Sei il sogno mio amor Ch'era sempre nel mio cuor Ora il sogno vero Perche son solo con te You alone you alone Are the dream I have known Bringing love to my lonely heart Now there's heaven in view Now the dream has come true For tonight I have you alone
