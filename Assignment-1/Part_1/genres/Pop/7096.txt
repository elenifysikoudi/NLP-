I've been laying low taking it slow Put the game in the side What's there to hide Tell me that you need me Tell I'm a keeper Tell me something I don't know Think before you say it Say it if you mean it Mean it because it doesn't show What a pleasant surprise A sight for sad eyes Where the hell have you been Why did you go home Tell me that you need me Tell I'm a keeper Tell me something I don't know Think before you say it Say it if you mean it Mean it because it doesn't show Tell me that you need me Tell I'm a keeper Tell me something I don't know Think before you say it Say it if you mean it Mean it because it doesn't show Oh I try yeah I try Try to scratch you out of my mind But my mind But my mind is made up and it just won't let it go I've got to know I've got to know I need to know Go ahead I dare you Tell me Tell me that you need me Tell I'm a keeper Tell me something I don't know Think before you say it Say it if you mean it Mean it because it doesn't show
