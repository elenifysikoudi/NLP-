You said don't worry we can still be friends but it's all over and we can't pretend You closed the door and turned off your lights left me standing alone on that cold dark night Oh I'm Mister Lonely now that were apart I'm Mister Lonely holdin my broken heart Some people say I'm a love sick fool and for all I know that maybe true Oh I'm Mister Lonely Now that there's no now that there's no you No I didn't get a Dear John letter You thought face to face would be better yes you did and tellin me you didn't wanna be my girl Well that made me feel like the loneliest guy in the world repeat chorus Oh what am I gonna do now that there's no you I haven't got a clue now that there's no you repeat chorus
