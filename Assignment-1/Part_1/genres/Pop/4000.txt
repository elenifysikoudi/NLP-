Don't wrap it up in gold Don't hide it behind the sun Just give it to me as it is And let it stand Don't fly it like a kite Between the clouds It needs no excuse just bring it down Let eyes that are in pain look upon it In all its glory Let us move on Let us move on For this is short And it will pass Let us move on Let us move on For this is short And it will pass For every voice that is lifted in reverence and pain Show us now And let love not be chained We should feel what we can stand and let us be alive So we know That we've done all we we can Let hearts that are frozen get to see In all its glory Let us move on Let us move on For this is short And it will pass Let us move on Let us move on For this is short And it will pass And let all that is lost be forgotten And it will pass So let all that is lost be forgotten Let us move on Like the waters and the open sea When tribulations come all we can say is hopefully And yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me But today I'm overly dedicated I'm posed to be a testimony for broken hearts in the city You either crash landing or planning on flyin with me Misery loves standing behind his company well Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell On our past encounters reaching over the counter Told me that it's appealing to pop a pill that's a downer I heard emotions burn deep I heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep I heard when you see a dove that's what you try be Got these burdens under my wings but I'm still free 'Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away Before I ever run astray I'll look you in the eye and say Let us move on Let us move on For this is short And it will pass Let us move on Let us move on For this is short And it will pass Let us move on Let us move on For this is short And it will pass Let us move on Let us move on For this is short And in the past And in the past
