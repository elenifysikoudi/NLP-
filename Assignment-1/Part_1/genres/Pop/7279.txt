Did you wake up on the right or the wrong side of the bed today Maybe your morning's running right on time or a little late Head out Traffic's slow on the interstate Take the back way Will this be a good or a bad day Well don't you worry I could be your sunshine girl Or the company for your misery I could be the quiet one Or the life of the party Whatever you need I'm your girl When you show up does everybody smile and wave or look away Are you feeling beautiful or is this a bad hair day Maybe you're falling so in love or your heart is about to break Will this be a good or a bad day Well either way I could be your sunshine girl Or the company for your misery I could be the quiet one Or the life of the party I could be your sunshine girl Or the company for your misery I could be the quiet one Or the life of the party Whatever you need I'm your girl Go ahead freak out I'm gonna stay So if you're happy or sad well baby you can look my way I could be your sunshine girl Or the company for your misery I could be the quiet one Or the life of the party I could be your sunshine girl Or the company for your misery I could be the quiet one Or the life of the party I could be your sunshine girl Or the company for your misery I could be the quiet one Or the life of the party Whatever you need I'm your girl
