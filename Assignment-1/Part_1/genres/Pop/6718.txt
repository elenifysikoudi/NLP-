Heaven sent an angel to me I'm in paradise when I look in her eyes Had a time when my heart couldn't see Thank God heaven sent an angel to me I used to pray for heaven to send me a love Cause heaven knows a lonely man can't get enough Each night and day I search my soul ask God above But I still come home all alone by myself In a world where the rain could last forever My heart was crying for sun After all of the times I said I'll never That's when my angel came along Heaven sent an angel to me I'm in paradise when I look in her eyes Had a time when my heart couldn't see Thank God heaven sent an angel to me I used to wonder what it'd be like to touch the sky Someone to love me and wipe away these tears I cried Held up my hands and hoped one day my heart would fly But I didn't know God was listening to me In a world where pain could last forever My heart was crying for love After all of the times I've said I'll never That's when my angel came from above Heaven sent an angel to me I'm in paradise when I look in her eyes Had a time when my heart couldn't see Thank God heaven sent an angel to me With every moment and every smile she brings I wanna love her give her my everything I'm on my knees thanking God up above Just how good it feels to be loved Heaven sent an angel to me I'm in paradise when I look in her eyes Had a time when my heart couldn't see Thank God heaven sent an angel to me Heaven sent an angel to me I'm in paradise when I look in her eyes Had a time when my heart couldn't see Thank God heaven sent an angel to me Heaven sent an angel to me Heaven sent an angel to me Heaven sent an angel to me Oh to me
