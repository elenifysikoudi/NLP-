I am a lineman for the county And I drive the main road Lookin in the sun for another overload I hear you singing in the wire I can hear you through the whine And the Wichita Lineman Is still on the line I know I need a small vacation But it don't look like rain And if it snows that stretch down south Won't ever stand the strain And I need you more than want you And I want you for all time And the Wichita Lineman Is still on the line
