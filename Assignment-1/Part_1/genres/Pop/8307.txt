Everytime when I'm feeling blue I look inside me and I remember you Everytime when I'm feeling blue I remember you Some words in my mind Talk about it all the time Again and again And they just make me cry Oh baby come on Before you give up and go Could you believe in love Bad words and good times In my mind don't survive Again and again And they just make me die Oh baby come on Before you give up and go Do you believe in love Baby I want to shake you up Shake you up shake you up Do you want to take my heart Baby I want to shake you up Shake you up shake you up Take me up baby give up Baby I want to shake you up Come on baby shake you up all I want is another way Baby I want to shake you up Oh my baby shake you up all I need is another say Sometimes on my mind I remember these times Again and again And they just tell me lies Oh baby come on Before you give up and go Could you believe in love Bad words and good times In my mind they revive Again and again And they don't say goodbye Oh baby come on Before you give up and go Do you believe in love Everytime when I'm feeling blue I look inside me and I remember you Everytime when I'm feeling blue I remember you Everytime when I'm feeling blue
