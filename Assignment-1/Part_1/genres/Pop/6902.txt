Too many times romantic words were spoken Too many words were lovers said in vain Too may times a foolish heart is broken And left just the memory for a token How do I know that you won't hurt me too Do you love me the way you kiss me cause you kiss me like You love me Do you mean everything you say and do you say everything You mean Do you love me the way you hold me cause you hold me like You love me Is it only a lovely dreamer can I dream on my wedding day
