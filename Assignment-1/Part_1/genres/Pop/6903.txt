Your eyes may thrill me with gladness And tell me you`re true dear Yet thoughts still fill me with sadness And what can I do dear I wonder if you are free I wonder if you are free Do you belong just to me I`m always jealous of you dear I`m not to be I am jealous of you darling Why am I so jealous darling Sad are the fancies that throng Through my heart everyday Lest someone else come along Who can steal you away All your beauty I would own I would have you mine alone Fear that someday we may part Still consumes me with pain What would become of my heart If I loved you in vain
