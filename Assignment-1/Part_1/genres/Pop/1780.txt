Oh Mary this London's a wonderful sight The people here are working by day and by night They don't sow potatoes nor barley nor wheat But there's gangs of them diggin for gold in the street At least when I asked them that's what I was told So I just took a hand at this diggin for gold But for all that I've found there I might as well be In the place where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea There's beautiful girls here oh never you mind Beautiful shapes nature never designed Lovely complexions of roses and cream But let me remark with regard to the same That if at those roses you venture to sip Colors might fall come away on your lips So I'll wait for the white rose that's waitin for me In the place where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea You remember young Davey McClaren of course Well sure now he's round here with the rest of the force I saw him one day as I was crossin the strand And he stopped the whole street with a wave of his hand And as we stood talkin of days that are gone The whole town of London stood there to look on But for all his great powers he's wishful like me To be back where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea But for all his great powers he's wishful like me To be back where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea
