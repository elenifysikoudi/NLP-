When it doesn't rain it snows Yeah the cookie crumbles but in who's hand All things said and all things done Life is short Oh I am young but I have aged Waited long to seize the day All things said and plenty done life is too short Ooooh could this be Ooooh could this be the day I've waited for Another door to peek in through The floor is filthy But the couch is clean At the end of the day That's another day gone Life is short Ooo life is short Ooooh Could this be Ooooh Could the be the day I've waited for Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba Oh I am young but I have aged Waited long to seize the day All things said and plently done Oh I am young but I have a past Travelled far to find the start Yes I am scared and I've been burnt But life is short Ooooh Could this be Ooooh Could this be the day I've waited for Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
