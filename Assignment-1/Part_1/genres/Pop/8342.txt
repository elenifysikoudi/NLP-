I'm watching all the pictures of you build up walls but memories are slipping through and I can't deny the truth anymore nothing will ever more be like before 'cause I'm fallin fallin every time I try and I'm hiding hiding every time I cry missing you feels like a crime and I'm fallin deeper every time Now I'm convinced I was the one to blame you and I will never be the same I miss you more and more every day that pass tell me how long this will last I'm not sure if I can take this any longer put my belief in that pain makes me stronger but I can't believe this is happenin to me I'm living a life no one else can see 'cause I'm fallin fallin every time I try and I'm hiding hiding every time I cry missing you feels like a crime and I'm fallin deeper every time Now I'm convinced I was the one to blame you and I will never be the same I miss you more and more every day that pass tell me how long this will last I'm fallin in between everyone the place I owned seems to be gone I'm falling for the one you are I'm falling for you and I'm falling too far
