Now I know how you feel Going down without a chance to deal No more friends to take your hands Without a reason to believe Do they know the way it feels Living in this world that's made of steel With no plans as a broken man Loosing your mind is hard to survive You don't have to kick and fight Because they'd never understand All you've got to do Believe in yourself Cause this is not the end Where is he gone there's still a chance We can try to take the right from wrong Let me stay show me your way Your sunny side until the end of the line You can say to me you're sorry But you know that it's no good This is not a story Baby this is you You've lost your mind you've lost your friends You've lost your everything again Without your love you can't pretend But if you keep this burning flame I'll understand I'll understand baby this is not the end
