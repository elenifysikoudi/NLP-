Dancing in the deep Her body Strengthens in a way We don't see In you and me These limbs They can take you higher They can take you higher Tailored by the moons She mates so well Perfected by the symmetry Her body tells Just you wait and see These limbs They can take you higher They can take you higher Sitting by the bed I can see through her skin She can hardly breathe a word Her body is so thin But I can still see These limbs They can break like branches They can break like branches
