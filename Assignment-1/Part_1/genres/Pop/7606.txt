For too long I was weak Too weak to find my feet I tried to hold it all inside So you'd never realise For too long I believed That you were good for me I closed my mind to other possibilities You tried to out my fire Maybe I was just too scared And maybe what you're looking for is gone 'Cause baby I Well people I've changed yes I don't feel the same they say I have a glow It's all because you're gone It's Independence Day Now I've found my way I don't need your love to prove that I'm somebody Maybe I was just too scared And maybe what you're Looking for is gone 'Cause baby I I learned to love myself I don't need no one else Oh baby can't you see that I don't need your chains around me You said that it was love It was just too much I needed to be free Your kind of love was killing me
