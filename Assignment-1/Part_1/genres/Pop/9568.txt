We walk the streets we follow light I follow you You take me on you lead the night I stick to you You hear my heart won't beat ahead You draw me in You take the night one step ahead You let me in Out of the fire and into the sun we are drowning in the bright light Out of the fire and into the sun we are dancing 'till the night dies Out of the fire and into the sun we are blinded by the big lights Out of the fire and into the sun we are dancing in the sunrise We leave the streets we fly away too high to reach We walk alone from here to way way out of reach I hear the sound from deep within one beat ahead We're closing in I see the edge one step ahead Out of the fire and into the sun we are drowning in the bright light Out of the fire and into the sun we are dancing 'till the night dies Out of the fire and into the sun we are blinded by the big lights Out of the fire and into the sun we are dancing in the sunrise We are starlight black sky lit up We are starlight black sky lit up We are starlight black sky lit up We are starlight black sky lit up Out of the fire and into the sun we are drowning in the bright light Out of the fire and into the sun we are dancing 'till the night dies Out of the fire and into the sun we are blinded by the big lights Out of the fire and into the sun we are dancing in the sunrise
