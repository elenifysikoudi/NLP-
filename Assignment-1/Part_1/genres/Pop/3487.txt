Tell me all the things that you thought weren't right about me and my life Tell me there's a way that i can shake this cloud and stand near to your light I never wanted anyone to say that i have hidden myself in disguise Please don't leave me lonely tell me all the ways to make myself right in your eyes But i can never heal myself enough for Never heal myself enough for you Tell me all the things that you thought weren't right about me and my life Tell me there's a way that i can shake this frown and see clear through your sight I never wanted anyone to say that i had let myself cry by your side Please don't leave me lonely tell me all the ways to make myself right in your eyes But i can never heal myself enough for Never heal myself enough No I can never heal myself enough for you
