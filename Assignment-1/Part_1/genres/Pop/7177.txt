My very ordinary sanguinary thoughts Make you feel insecure I don't care any more Did my opinions kill your reputation Ripped your elegant plans That's the way that I am Darling your lonely nights Have turned into lonely days I just want to know Are you scared of the real thing Are you searching for sympathy Walking a wire on your own Running round in syharitic circles But the ghosts in your path They were there from the start Wrapped around your need to feed your ego Lost yourself in the race And the hunger remains Darling your lonely nights Have turned into lonely days I just want to know Are you scared of the real thing Are you searching for sympathy Walking a wire on your own You want it you got it You want it you got it You want it you take it Then you're sorry You do it all again tomorrow No one cares and no one follows You want it you got it You want it you got it You want it you take it Then you're sorry Swallowing the same excuses Falling in the same holes Darling your lonely nights Have turned into lonely days I just want to know Are you scared of the real thing Are you searching for sympathy Walking a wire on your own I just want to know Are you waiting for something When your world is in darkness When you're alone
