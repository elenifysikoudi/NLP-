I'll pray for you if you give me time I've had a thousand hearts Now you're after mine It's not your fault that I've loved to my limit I've had plenty so I know you're mine If only a prayer would make your touch so I'd feel it But I'd be wasting time It's good to love I've got a right to give It's good to love But when you give yourself away It always hurts too much So you pray to get it back Only God can give you that Make my body come alive I've got a right to hurt inside So will you hold me while I cry And let me lay against your side So let me love It's good to love Just let me love it's good to love My skins irking Soft from friction paused Touch me softly like our kiss is lost It's not your fault that I've loved to my limit I've had plenty so I know you're mine If only a prayer would make your touch so I'd feel it But I'd be wasting time It's good to love I've got a right to give So good to love so good to love But when you give yourself away It always hurts to much So you pray to get it back Only God can give you that Make my body come alive I've got a right to hurt inside So will you hold me while I cry And let me lay against your side So let me love It's good to love Just let me love it's good to love It's good to love I've got a right to give So good to love so good to love But when you give yourself away It always hurts to much So I pray to get it back Only God can give you that Make my body come alive I've got a right to hurt inside So will you hold me while I cry And let me lay against your side So let me love It's good to love So let me love It's good to love Just let me love Just let me love It's good to love
