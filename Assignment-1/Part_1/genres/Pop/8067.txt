Wise men say only fools rush in But I can't help falling in love with you Shall I stay would it be a sin If I can't help falling in love with you Like a river flows slowly to the sea Darling so it goes Some things are meant to be Take my hand take my whole life too 'Cause I can't help falling in love with you 'Cause I can't help falling in love with you No I can't help falling in love with you
