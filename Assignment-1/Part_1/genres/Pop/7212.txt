Here it comes the fools parade Another clueless masquerade And they're way too slow A waste of space Yes they're way too slow Get out of the way Go away In my way Go away In the way oh Here we go a suckers ride Hearts and minds are paralyzed And they're way too stupid They'll be just fine Yes they're way too stupid A waste of time Everybody's looking for something Everybody's looking for clues And they're way too late They missed the news And they think they're great With their fucked up points of view Go away In my way Go away In the way oh All because you thought for yourself now Naughty girl you thought for yourself now Go away Go away
