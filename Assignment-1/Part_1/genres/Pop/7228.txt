My own life's a dream I make believe A veil of blood ties a worn out elegy It wont hurt it wont hurt anymore My dark night your mood is on the wane And dawn will set her light to bring me home again It wont hurt it wont hurt anymore When half the world lies alone in all their dreams Ill see the curtain rise with all tomorrow brings It wont hurt it wont hurt it wont hurt anymore anymore My own life a dream I make believe A veil of blood ties a worn out elegy My own life a worn out elegy My own life a dream I make believe
