Listen See this girl she walks up to me Got body like you would not believe First glance She had me in a trance I think that she dropped down and stopped Pop her hip twice Worked that down Then up with the lift like damn Time to take a chance Cause oh what you do to me Look what I do to get her I'd play the fool to get her I'd cross the world to get her I gots to gots to get her get her I'd fight the rest to get her I'd spend my last to get her Might be crazy might go broke But all I know I've gots to get her Every little thing that she does is magic All I really know is I've got to have it Can't believe that I'm here a witness She's got me her thought is relentless damn She knows that I'm a fan I'm such a fan of her Hold that thought like it or not She's got that walk make any jaw drop She'll make ya stop and wanna take her picture Diddy bop and take her home with ya She knows that I just wanna make her mine But everybody wanna get in line She's holding back but I let her know She's about to let it go I'd fight the rest to get her I'd spend my last to get her Might be crazy might go broke But all I know I've gots to get her Get that name swallow my pride Ain't got no shame I gotta catch that dive She already caught my eye Beatboxing I'm gonna get it I'm gonna get it I'm gonna get it I see this beauty and I know that she'd feel it She hear that music and she lean back rock with it Everything about her she's a one stop shop get it You make a move you better come come come with it Just can't stop watchin the clock Time flies tick tock She's got me off my game Feel's like I'm going insane Cause oh what you do to me I'd fight the rest to get her I've got to I'd spend my last to get her I've got to Might be crazy might go broke But all I know I've gots to get her See this girl she walks up to me Got body like you would not believe First glance She had me in a trance
