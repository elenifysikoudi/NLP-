How can I love you when you're not around You wanted it all and then you let me down You made me promises you know you never keep How can I ever show you loyalty Why is it that you always make a fuss Can it be that you don't care about us How can I love you when I don't know where to start How can I love you when you break my heart If you love me let me know if you don't want me tell me so 'Cause I won't be waiting for you don't want to waste my time Just let me know so I can live my life I've always given you the best of me Are you so blind that you can't see All the things that you have put me through You knew that I would never do to you no I think of all the days and nights we shared And start to wonder if you ever really cared How can I love you when I don't know where I stand Just let me know so I can make my plans If you love me let me know if you don't want me tell me so 'Cause I won't be waiting for you don't want to waste my time Just let me know so I can live my life If you love me let me know if you don't want me tell me so 'Cause this can't be love when you're hurting me this much If this is love I don't want to know Why do you keep messing with my heart and mind i really need to know Something that you seem to do most of the time messing with my mind Can't you tell how much this is hurting me Or are you too blind to see The tears that fill my eyes oh baby If you love me let me know if you don't want me tell me so 'Cause I won't be waiting for you don't want to waste my time Just let me know so I can live my life If you love me let me know if you don't want me tell me so 'Cause this can't be love when you're hurting me this much If this is love I don't want to know
