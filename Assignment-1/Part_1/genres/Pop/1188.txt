I took the paper from the table just to send you a song But after waiting several hours I found out you were gone I was a little underwhelmed with all the pictures you took But that one over in the corner caught you in a good look Have you ever been afraid of someone getting so close I mean it's natural for a person to hold on to it most That is their privacy and I can see you're feeling like that So I'll unbreak the window and unpick the lock in the back I don't know if she'll remember my name the minute we're finally alone But she'll not forget when she sees me again cause I will make sure that she won't It's so easy I guess it's easy enough enough 'Cause you're so easy you're just so easy to love to love I walked around until i couldn't quite remember my name And got all covered in your sheets til I forgot why I came Oh yes I hope she doesn't mind all of the glass on the floor Surely she'll be happy to see me when she walks through the door I don't think that she'll remember my name whenever she finally gets home But I'm gonna make sure she knows who I am and then she will not be alone It's so easy I guess it's easy enough enough 'Cause you're so easy you're just so easy to love to love It's so easy I guess it's easy enough enough 'Cause you're so easy you're just so easy to love to love I can see you but you can't see me I can see you you look so pretty I can see you but you can't see me Maybe one day you'll be my sweetie But you can't see me but you can't see me It's so easy I guess it's easy enough enough 'Cause you're so easy you're just so easy to love to love
