Inside it harbors Desire bruises my skin So near I'm hungry I'd like to have more In control I've lost it I'd like to try it again It warms inside me We're moving one step closer each time There's nobody like you Nobody like you Nobody like you Nobody like you anyway oh anyway There's nobody like you Nobody like you Nobody can touch you Nobody like you anyway oh anyway Everyone knows We fall slow motion I taste your breath in my veins Like waves vibrations It's coming up again Let me climb inside you Caress your fever tongue Spread my wings around you And we can slide There's nobody like you Nobody like you Nobody like you Nobody like you anyway oh anyway There's nobody like you Nobody like you Nobody can touch you Nobody like you anyway oh anyway Everyone knows I've always craved I tried to feed the hunger of an empty grave You've shown me secrets I've not forgotten I'll give you all the love that I take That I take Inside it harbors Desire bruises my skin So near I'm hungry We're moving one step closer each time There's nobody like you Nobody like you Nobody like you Nobody like you anyway oh anyway There's nobody like you Nobody like you Nobody can touch you Nobody like you anyway oh anyway There's nobody like you Can you can you can oh oh oh There's nobody like you Can you can you can oh oh oh There's nobody like you Can you can you can oh oh oh
