Saw you again it is like some kind of sin is turning its back on me straight to the point where rumours can annoy you are always in brilliant skies as I wander by Pray for the day when you say you will stay you have gotten a hold of yourself raised for the race we are not what we say there are always a million signs dont be afraid to say you are wandering and life is a dream starlight it seems to keep escaping me so I rely on you rains for a hundred days why cant you see the race is not over still you are holding your prize it could rain for a hundred years can you see your fears are over your head holding you light dont be afraid to say you are wandering and life is a dream starlight it seems to keep escaping me why do you run from love and why do you run something more is gaping lost in your mind is only what you seem to be where are you going you are going straight in dont be afraid to say you are wandering and life is a dream starlight it seems to keep escaping me so I rely on luck
