Nothing but heartaches oo nothing but heartaches He brings nothing but heartaches Oo I can't break away from his arms I can't break away from his charms I can't break away from his kiss cause his kiss I surely miss All my life I needed someone to need me so I do my very best to please him But the more and more I care the more of him other girls share When I need a hand to hold that's the time he leaves me all alone Just keeps me keeps me cryin myself to sleep Nothing but heartaches oo nothing but heartaches But I can't break away oh no keep a loving him more each day Oo I can't break away from his arms I can't break away from his charms I can't break away from his kiss cause his kiss I'll surely miss To him I'm loyal to him I'm true Why can't he be the same way too But the more my love has grown the less love he has shown He makes promises he doesn't keep Sometimes I don't see him all week Just keeps me keeps me cryin myself to sleep Nothing but heartaches oo nothing but heartaches But I can't break away oh no keep a loving him more each day Oo I can't break away from his arms I can't break away from his charms I can't break away from his kiss cause his kiss I'll surely miss
