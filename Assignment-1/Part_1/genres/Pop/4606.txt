It's the chance of life get ready set fly high Above the fear of your mind Go for it it's hit or miss Too late for you to quit You gotta show em how bad you really want this Live your dreams it's not as hard as it may seem You gotta work to get the cream On your hopes you must lean From your fears you have to win yourself It's all or nothing Give your everything Are what you believe you've got to bring the dreams Set the pace let competitions take the lead This is it all eyes on you So stay on point and prove That you deserve what's long overdue Live your dreams it's not as hard as it may seem You gotta work to get the cream On your hopes you must lean From your fears you have to win yourself It's all or nothing give your everything The hardest to recovery From the heartbreak of another kind I'm still drying my tears Getting over my own fears In my life so I want to make sure this time That I'm strong enough To give it my all So you have got to live your dreams So don't you be afraid Just set the pace and take the lead It's your time to shine
