I opened the door to your head Tried going quietly But the door slammed instead I yelled why'd I even come here But still I stayed for a while Looked in every drawer that I could find Saw your calender on the floor You're not very organized are you I said to myself I said to myself You should go you should leave Won't stop pulling on my sleeve But I stood there I stood there With a note from my head Opposite of what my heart said Oh I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I went through all your dirty laundry Even all your smelly socks I wonder where where those even came from I saw everything you had lying around From your deck of cards to the Way you feel about me just lying on the ground I said to myself I said to myself You should go you should leave Won't stop pulling on my sleeve But I stood there I stood there With a note from my head Opposite of what my heart said Oh I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I said to myself I said to myself You should go you should leave Won't stop pulling on my sleeve But I stood there I stood there With a note from my head Opposite of what my heart said Oh I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know Oh I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know I should not be here you know
