You're a centipede crawling down my spine You're the evil world of the nursery rhyme You're the drug in which I fly Drag me under Douse the tracks Dressed in anger Hit back hit back hit back You're an open wound that was left to bleed You're my only friend Don't be cruel to me I smash the looking glass against my head Let my senses burn as my body bled We are immigrants in a fractured time Found the pieces of a life that's mine You're all I fear that I might find Drag me under Douse the track Dressed in anger Hit back hit back hit back Oh oh oh oh You're an animal in an open cage You're an orchestra in a manic phase You're the dream in which I die Drag me under Douse the track Dressed in anger Hit back hit back hit back Drag me under Douse the track Dressed in anger Hit back hit back hit back Hit back hit back hit back
