I remember many things like summer sky's and fire flies just simple things like the little symphony you hear each time a Robin sings yes I remember many things It wasn't very long ago that Peter pan and I would would fly away and go to that very strange enchanted place that only children know no it wasn't very long ago Dancing in the moonlight to your favourite song and dreaming dreams that dreamers often do waiting for the day that special someone comes along oh how I love just one more chance to dream that dream and dance that dance Memories I still embrace Like hiding from the world inside my secret place and the way i'd laugh when clowns would smile and make a funny face these are memories I can't erase I remember when we wished upon a star when time was on our side we had it all tomorrow will be yesterday in just a dream or two I wish that I could start again but now is now and then was then When I go to sleep at night I think of all I've done and hope I did it right 'Cos now I know I'm so aware how life goes by at twice the speed of light leaving you with just your memories Each memory I'll cherish all my life 'Cos I have lived and i'll fill my cup I remember many things but I don't remember ever growing up don't remember ever growing up
