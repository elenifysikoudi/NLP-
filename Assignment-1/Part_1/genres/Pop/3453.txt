Eleven days a dozen nights A thousand tears and you are my shoulder From summer's haze on morning light The sun is rising just like I told you If you fall I'll never let your spirit break If you call I'll always soothe the cries you make If it's all I can do I'll slowly kiss your dreams awake You're not alone for heavens sake Mercury rising From winter skies a cold embrace The shadows meet and they drag you under The moonlight's mine and yours to chase Your star is rising beyond your wonder If you fall I'll never let your spirit break If you call I'll always soothe the cries you make If it's all I can do I'll slowly kiss your dreams awake You're not alone for heavens sake Mercury's rising You're not alone for heaven sake Your tears run so freely your fears run so deeply down The pressure is breaking quicksilver awaking now Can you feel it rise Can you see it rise Droplets of dreams that you touched disappear There's change in the weather and wind in your hair And Mercury's rising Mercury's rising Rising rising Mercury's rising Eleven days a dozen nights A thousand tears and you are my shoulder From summer's haze on morning light The sun is rising just like I told you
