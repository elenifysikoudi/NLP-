We're gonna do our own thang Just do what we do First class on the plane Just do what we do After parties in jacuzzi's Just do what we do You hear our songs in the Movies Just do what we do Freshest kicks on our feet Just do what we do New shades every week Just do what we do Swaggers like a good fella Just do what we do We don't even have to tell ya Just do what we do Dance til you drop with The Fooo and your buddies We don't really care what you say We're gonna scream and shout all day Until we lose our lungs Until we lose our lungs Every day is Another party Yea we're living life our own way Until we lose our lungs Until we lose our lungs Rolled limo to the prom Just do what we do Bass rattled like a bomb Just do what we do Left our tuxes at the mansion Just do what we do Sagging jeans and dirty dancing Just do what we do We blow a kiss to the haters Just do what we do Hating on us cause we're famous Just do what we do Skinny dipping in the pool Just do what we do And we're acting a fool Dance til drop with The Fooo and your buddies We don't really care what you say We're gonna scream and shout all day Until we lose our lungs Until we lose our lungs Every day is Another party Yea we're living life our own way Until we lose our lungs Until we lose our lungs So we were born in the 90's yea born in the 90's So our faces look dashing in the bus ads passing Sporting black sunglasses every single day Haters don't know how to swag the right way But all the Foooers do but all the Foooers do Our memories a blurry G cause all the cities that we see Enough about us how you feeling everybody Dance til you drop with The Fooo and your buddies Dance til you drop with The Fooo and your buddies Dance til you drop with The Fooo and your buddies We don't really care what you say We're gonna scream and shout all day Until we lose our lungs Until we lose our lungs Every day is Another party Yea we're living life our own way Until we lose our lungs Until we lose our lungs We don't really care what you say We're gonna scream and shout all day Until we lose our lungs Until we lose our lungs
