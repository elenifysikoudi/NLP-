There's not a soul inside How did I ever get here I'm missing life before wish you would re appear But I fell so hard I went beneath the surface You see a lovely dance slowing disappearing Is it a sweet dream or is it a nightmare I can't sleep without you right here Lost in the middle of nowhere I need you now Feels like I'm on a lonely island Waiting for ya Waiting for ya On this lonely island Waiting for ya Waiting for ya Save me from this lonely island Save me from this lonely island Searching high and low Took my mind to another planet Didn't love this love could cause me so much damage But the thought of you keeps me heart from wondering Are these lovely sands slowly re appearing Is it a sweet dream or is it a nightmare I can't sleep without you right here Lost in the middle of nowhere I need you now Feels like I'm on a lonely island Waiting for ya Waiting for ya On this lonely island Waiting for ya Waiting for ya Feels like I'm on a lonely island Waiting for ya Waiting for ya On this lonely island Waiting for ya Waiting for ya
