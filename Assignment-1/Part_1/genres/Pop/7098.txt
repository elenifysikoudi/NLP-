I can't keep up with myself anymore Anymore of this and I might lose it completely I might lose the lot I can't keep up with myself anymore I can't keep up with myself anymore Sadness steals like the code And my tears are falling dry Darkness steals from the sun And my toes are cold at night And my tears are falling dry Sadness steals like the cold And my tears are falling dry Darkness steals from the sun And my toes are cold at night Sadness steal like the cold And my tears are falling dry Darkness steals from the sun And my toes are cold night like the dawn
