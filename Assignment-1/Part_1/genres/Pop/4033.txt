A young gentleman came riding past On a snow blue winters day He asked to drink by our fire And I was pleased to let him stay He drank there quietly for a while And then he turned and said to me Your eyes are green Like summer grass Your lips are red Like a fresh cut rose Your hair is soft Like an Irish stream And your voice Is filled with sweet beauty And the last words I heard him say Were I shall return For you My love On Christmas Day And the night will come But I won't sleep As I watch the stars that lead him I cannot place where he is But still my heart goes with him I'm saving all my Sunday clothes For the day that I'll be leaving Father knows My sister knows And my friends They're happy for me And the priest he says You should thank God For the blessing Of such beauty And the last words I heard him say Were I shall return For you My love On Christmas Day I shall return For you My love On Christmas Day On Christmas Day I shall return for you my love And the last words I heard him say Were the last words I ever Heard him say I shall return For you My love On Christmas Day I swear I will return On Christmas Day And yes I shall return On Christmas Day I shall return For you On Christmas Day My love I will return On Christmas Day I shall return My love On Christmas Day On Christmas Day
