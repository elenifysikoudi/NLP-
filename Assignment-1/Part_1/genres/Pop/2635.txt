So the winter comes where we belong I feel the cold within my heart I see the night deep in your eyes The winter comes at last Here the winter comes again Here the winter comes again Here the winter comes again Here the winter comes again So the winter comes where we grow strong I hear your words melt like snow On my skin I taste your kiss it tastes like snow The winter comes to last My tongue is frozen to the ground I cry alone for times to come It beats the daylight out of me The winter comes to seize the day The winter comes to seize the day Here the winter comes again Here the winter comes again Here the winter comes again Here the winter comes again Again Again
