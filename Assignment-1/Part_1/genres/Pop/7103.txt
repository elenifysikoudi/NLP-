Oh I do I try to For the love of love And for the love of loving's sake Take all the ones you fear And all the ones you hate Cook a hearty stew Brush a smile and fill their plates Why is it so simple Why is it so hard to say Oh I do I try to For the love of love And don't delay for goodness sake Take all the ones you trust And all the ones you hold so dear Pass around the wine Drink it up Shed a tear Why is it so simple Why is it so hard to say Then sing it on Oh I do I try to Oh I do I love you Oh I do I try to Oh I've got to push push myself Oh I must be brave To save the world Oh I do I love you
