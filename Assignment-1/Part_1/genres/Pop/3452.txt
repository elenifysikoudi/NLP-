"You said its over I said ""that's okay I wasn't in to you anyway"" I told you ""lately You irritate me your laugh is too loud You're the last girl I'd look at If you were in a crowd"" Could you tell I was lying and hiding the truth away And what I really wanted to say Is you are incredible you are amazing You blow my mind one of a kind I'm having a meltdown You are incredible you are amazing But sometimes telling the truth Is easier said than done ""don't leave baby"" Now that's what I meant to say ""My worlds not ending I'll be just fine"" That's what my mouth said But not what I felt inside I told you ""baby Your not the answer to all of my prayers 'cause I like my girlfriends in short skirts with longer hair"" Could you tell I was lying and hiding the truth away And what I really wanted to say Well I said I didn't care about what you felt about me Couldn't care less about what I said or done I didn't mean it its not what I meant to say You know the truth is that I care About what you think about me Maybe too much I've been puttin on a front I didn't mean it and what I meant to say Is you are incredible you are amazing You blow my mind one of a kind I'm having a meltdown You are incredible you are amazing But sometimes telling the truth Is easier said than done yeah yeah Telling the truth is easier said than done Can't you see Telling the truth is easier said than done ""Don't leave baby"" now that's what I meant to say"
