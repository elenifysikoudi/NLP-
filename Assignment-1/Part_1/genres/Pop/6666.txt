It's all because of you I'm feeling sad and blue You went away now my life is just a rainy day And I love you so How much you'll never know You've gone away and left me lonely Untouchable memories Seem to keep haunting me Now the love so true That once turned all my gray skies blue But you disappeared Now my eyes are filled with tears And I'm wishing you were heare with me Soaked with love all my thoughts of you Now that you're gone I just don't know what to do If only you were here You'd wash away my tears The sun would shine once again You'd be mine oh mine But in reality You and I will never be 'cause you took your love away from me SPOKEN Girl I dunno what I did to make you leave me But what I do know that since you've been gone there's such an emptiness inside I miss you and wish you'd come back to me If only you were here You'd wash away my tears The sun would shine once again You'd be mine oh mine But in reality You and I will never be 'cause you took your love away from me
