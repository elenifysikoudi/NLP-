You're the hole in my umbrella The soaking wet behind my ears The bloodstain on my name The same disease I've had for years If I went to see the doctor He would say to stay away But why should I heed advice The hospital charges twice When it's possible to feel worse Sid and Nancy loved each other I want you to be my Undercutter We'll watch the stars lying in the gutter I need you to be my Undercutter Jezebel of my novella We're soaking wet between the sheets These feelings never change I'm happy to be deranged Without you I'm incomplete
