Hello are you thinking about me Thinking about you How long do you dream about me Dreaming about you when you sleep If all you see is a lost inside of me When my hair brushes my shoulders When I cry be that tissue Ooh love I feel it now more than ever I feel so good underneath Ooh love love No stay seeing it all through Needed to be you Stay here being so lonely Falling if only When my hair brushed my shoulder When I cry be that tissue Ooh love I feel it now more than ever I feel so good underneath Ooh love love Ooh my weight keeps lifting The ground beneath me shook And I am wishing you to me Come on baby let me see you When my hair brushed my shoulder When I cry be that tissue Ooh love I feel it now more than ever I feel so good underneath Ooh love love love love love
