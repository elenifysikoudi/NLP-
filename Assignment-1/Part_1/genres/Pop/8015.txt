If you're feeling fancy free Come wander through the world with me And any place we chance to be Will be our rendezvous Two for the road we'll travel down the years Collecting precious memories Selecting souvenirs and living life the way we please In summertime the sun will shine In winter we'll drink summer wine And every day that you are mine Will be a lovely day As long as love still wears a smile I know that we'll be two for the road And that's a long long while Instrumental interlude and pick up at In summertime the sun will shine In winter we'll drink summer wine And every day that you are mine Will be a lovely day As long as love still wears a smile I know that we'll be two for the road And that's a long long while
