Every day a different woman sleeps by his side And every day he tells each one he loves her like a bride Every night he walks in the house where he's built a family He tells his wife he loves her alone and they both fall asleep Oh His words are like a refuge for each woman that he sees But to him his words are like dust that blows away with the breeze In his heart he knows he could be much more of a man But he's fed himself the lies that make him doubt he can And he says Now I am swimming across an ocean Dragging a ship by my feet Cause words on their own become empty emotion You never know what to believe Oh Now I am swimming across an ocean Dragging a ship by my feet Cause words on their own become empty emotion You never know what to believe Don't tell me what I should believe Oh
