Too many things have happened To tear our love apart When we got together We were doomed from the start Didn't see the signs or realise The end would soon be near And there'd be no more tears Should have seen that it was over But we chose to carry on There was no more love just anger All we had was gone If you need for me to tell you Confirmation of the truth Our love is over Our love is over Time to turn the pages Time to start anew I know that I can do it I can do it without you Our love is over Our love is over Time to turn the pages Time to start anew I know that I can do it I can do it without you If you need for me to tell you Confirmation of the truth Our love is over Our love is over Our love is over Said things to each other We said things out of spite We were hurting one another All we ever did was fight We'd play silly games of love and hate And put each other down We lost the final round Should have seen that it was over But we chose to carry on There was no more love just anger All we had was gone If you need for me to tell you Confirmation of the truth Our love is over Our love is over Time to turn the pages Used to fuss and fight Never took the time to look around and see How much I was hurting you And you were hurting me If you need for me to tell you Confirmation of the truth Our love is over Time to turn the pages
