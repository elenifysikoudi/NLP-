Maybe your guilt is making you feel you want to apologise But it's too late it's your mistake Your time has now expired Save your concerns for someone else Don't ask me how I am You don't know how I feel How many times do I have to tell you that it's no big deal It's all right cause I'm fine Baby you should know that I'm much stronger I'll survive Keep saying you're sorry the same old story Excuses lame and tired You never knew me Took me for stupid The damage had been done Save your concerns for someone else Don't ask me how I am You don't know how I feel How many times do I have to tell you that it's no big deal It's all right cause I'm fine Baby you should know that I'm much stronger I'll survive You won't get the satisfaction Won't see me breaking down I'm sick of all your stories And why you fool around Now you look for solace You won't find it in these arms Because it's just too late baby By you I'm no longer charmed By you babe Save your concerns for someone else Don't ask me how I am You don't know how I feel How many times do I have to tell you that it's no big deal It's all right cause I'm fine Baby don't you know that I'm much stronger I'll survive It's all right cause I'm fine Just want to let you know Just want to let you know You don't know how I feel No big deal
