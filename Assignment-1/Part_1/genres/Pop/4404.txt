I've been watchin you a while Your walk your talk even your smile Keepin my attention focused just on you I wonder if you're here alone Or if you have a girl at home Tell me I just wanna know Then you turned around And gestured to your boys Like you were rollin out So I said Hey you hey you hey you I don't know your name But I'd really like to know Hey you hey you hey you I don't know your name But wouldn't you like to go Somewhere to grab a bite to eat So we can talk in privacy And learn a bit about your personality The huntress captured by the game Cause my intentions weren't the same No I'm not tryin to take you home So as you walk out Say your name again It's so hard to pronounce So I said Hey you hey you hey you I don't know your name But I'd really like to know Hey you hey you hey you I don't know your name But wouldn't you like to go Out to see a movie I think that that would be real groovy I know I'm sounding kinda loony Cause that's what I like Cause I like people watchin' Here I go again I see something I like So I say Hey you hey you hey you I don't know your name But I'd really like to know Hey you hey you hey you I don't know your name But wouldn't you like to go
