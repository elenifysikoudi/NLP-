You say that you really love me I'm always on your mind And you say I should be your lover And we should spend some time But I'm not persuaded that quickly My heart has been broken before you see So if you want to be my lover You have to prove your love is true to me Cause it's easy to tell me you love me Easy to say your thinking of me Words are so easy to say Show me Show me you really love me Actions speak louder than words Show me Show me you really need me Cause all those lies I've already heard Show me Show me you really love me Let me believe that it's true Show me Show me you really need me And I'll get together with you You say that there is no other I am the only one And you say that if we were lovers We would have so much fun But my mother warned me That I should beware of yound boys saying things that you say So I must be sure that if I give you my love You won't take it then run away Cause it's easy to tell me you love me Easy to say your thinking of me Words are so easy to say Show me Show me you really love me Actions speak louder than words Show me Show me you really need me Cause all those lies I've already heard Show me Show me you really love me Let me believe that it's true Show me Show me you really need me And I'll get together with you
