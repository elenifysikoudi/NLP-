In my time I've been a few places And I've many a story to tell Here I am still as strong As I've been all along I'm not ready for heaven or hell There are people who do need reminding That I'm still the boss around here I still call every shot And I'll tell you what's what And what's not do I make myself clear I'm not ready to roll over I'm still the daddy of the all I'm still the top banana They still answer when I call I'm older yes but I'm wiser And they better not forget I'm not ready to roll over 'Cause there's life in the old dog yet You can't put an old head on young shoulders My advice is the best I can give Let them make their mistakes Let them fight for their rights Let them learn how to love and to live I've only got the one daughter Time she married a man of her own And the one I have planned Has got plenty of land She'll be grand and I'll stand all alone I'm not ready to roll over I'm still the daddy of the all I'm still the top banana They still answer when I call I'm older yes but I'm wiser And they better not forget I'm not ready to roll over 'Cause there's life in the old dog yet I'm not ready to roll over I'm still the daddy of the all I'm still the top banana They still answer when I call I'm older yes but I'm wiser And they better not forget I'm not ready to roll over 'Cause there's life in the old dog yet 'Cause there's life in this old dog yet
