All tender moments All my time with you Everyday we're much closer You respond to me I respond to you I always knew That you'd be good for me But without you I could never be Want you to know I'll never let you down Just put your trust in me I'll always be around 'Cause you're a miracle That's happened Miracle that's happened Miracle that's happened to me You came along When I was in need You're the love inside of me I've watched our love grow It's a love so deep Everyday it's much stronger You're the love stop love inside of me I never thought I'd find a love like this A love so pure You have fulfilled my wish Now we've made plans For us to stay together The way I feel now I know I'll never leave you You're a miracle that's happened
