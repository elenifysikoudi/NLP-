Once upon a time I used to be a Socialist Until they ran out of room for a vocalist Community we share and share alike How can I share what isn't mine I can't share what isn't mine I can't spare what isn't mine Once I flew a plane to the land of philanthropy Until it crashed down in a sea of apathy In unity we live until we die Why should I bear what isn't mine I can't bear what isn't mine I shouldn't bear what isn't mine One hungry son of a bitch Super sperm with a ten inch dick International top of the list I've go the world by its balls
