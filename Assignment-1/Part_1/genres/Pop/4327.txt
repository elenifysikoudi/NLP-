I won't take my medicine I won't settle my debts no Sell your house sell your kids Don't settle for less no I've been traveling around here Searching for a real thing Maybe I could call my own But all these signs they read unclear Take the time to figure out I know Which way I want to go I guess you'll never say I won't take my medicine I won't settle my debts no Sell your house sell your kids Don't settle for less no I won't take my medicine I won't settle my debts no So hopeless for your love So thanks for nothing In front of you you'll never see I swear to God I'll throw away Don't make no never mind to me Cause having much of anything Is second to it sinking through It's never done so easily
