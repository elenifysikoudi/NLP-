What's it all about ah ha ha Spent my whole life praying for a chance to be here And things are not the same as expected It's been a hard time Oh to be wrong There's no heaven in the sky Have you ever Well here's your chance and you can't tell me This is wrong There's no heaven in the sky Have you ever have you ever have you ever Cared to scream First you steal my breath ha ha ha And now I'm short on trust I stand up for the test And then I lie down Oh to be wrong There's no heaven in the sky Have you ever Well here's your chance and you can't tell us This is wrong There's no heaven in the sky Have you ever have you ever have you ever Cared to scream Cared to scream Let me take you down 'cause I feel divine Like some holy cow On a fallen shrine Like a waterfall Made of alcohol Oh why tell me why Waiting for a friend ah ha ha It's been a long time I'm waiting here again Such a long time Long long long Long long long You oh you bring me down You you kill me You kill me You kill me
