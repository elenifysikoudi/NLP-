She is young and oh So pretty With a twinkle in her eyes And just the kind of features To make a young man sigh She is sweet and she is sunny Just like a morn in May She's just the kind of creature Who could steal your heart away But She's not the one that's meant for me The one that Heaven sent for me I know although I haven't found her yet She's not the one she's not the one She's not the one that I'll care for The one I'll always be there for Don't ask the why or the wherefore I know She's not the one she's not the one Can her smile light up the morning Can her laughter lift the night Can she hold you when you're troubled And make everything alright Can she fill each waking moment Who knows Perhaps she can And yes I realize She'd be a prize for any man But She's not the one that's meant for me The one that Heaven sent for me I know although I haven't found her yet She's not the one she's not the one She's not the one that I'll care for The one I'll always be there for Don't ask the why or the wherefore I know She's not the one she's not the one
