Every breath you take Every move you make Every bond you break Every step you take I'll be watching you Every single day Every word you say Every game you play Every night you stay I'll be watching you Oh can't you see You belong to me And my poor heart aches Every step you take Every move you make Every vibe you break Every smile you fake Every claim you stake I'll be watching you Since you've gone I've been lost Without a trace Dream at night I can only see your face Look around but It's you I can't replace Feel so cold But I long For your embrace Keep crying baby baby Oh can't you see You belong to me And my poor heart aches Every breath you take Every move you make Every vibe you break Every smile you fake Every claim you stake I'll be watching you I'll be watching you Tonight I'll be watching you Tonight I'll be watching you Tonight I'll be watching you Tonight I'll be watching you Tonight I'll be watching you
