"Aisle of fire close to you and desire I'm half way home The worst stings in life have left me numb Please don't leave this disaster The hummingbird as my imposter Aching sighs To the words and the writing I'm blind Ghosts run in my angels eyes Sing words so soft from my mind Believe the eyes of iolite Please don't believe the way they want you to leave Blaming arms are better I think left alone Ghost ride in my angels eyes steal words so soft from my mind believe in the eyes of iolite ""Tell you why I won't cry Tempted by life Want this strife I suppose Tell you know I was light Iolite"""
