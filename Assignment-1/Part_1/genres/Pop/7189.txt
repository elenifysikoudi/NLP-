I get it on When I lay my fingers on Let me drift away Take me to a place I have known before Let me hear the words you know I adore Let me slip away to a world I know When you sing Oh oh oh oh take me I am a slave to your charms Turn it on And I want to celebrate I can hear your song Rushing through my veins it surrounds me now Touching me inside I can ride the sound When you sing Oh oh oh oh take me I am a slave to your charms Turn it on Can I lay my fingers on Soaking in the way you shine Your rhythm slides around my mind I've really got it now Serenades that nearly split my senses Oh so special Turn it on When you sing Oh oh oh oh take me I am a slave to your charms Turn it on And I want to celebrate Get it on Get it on Get it on Get it on
