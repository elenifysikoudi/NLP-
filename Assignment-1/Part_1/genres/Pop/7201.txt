It's the time of the scene They radiate a different heat Till the last big flame is stamped upon Along comes another along comes another All stand up now here comes the scene All stand up now here comes the scene It's the turn of the clowns Let's build it up and knock it back down We could tear it up and start it all over Let's prey upon another Let's pray upon another All stand up now here comes the scene All stand up now here comes the scene All take a bow here comes the Queen All stand up now here comes the scene
