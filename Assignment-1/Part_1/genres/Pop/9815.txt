Drink your coffee Read your paper And look into the mirror As you watch yourself get dressed Here comes summer There goes spring Life is easy When you don't feel a thing And not another single soul Has even crossed your mind As far as other people go You haven't got the time Chorus Cause you're selfish vain and so damn cruel But everything that comes around goes around too Cause your selfish vain and so damn cruel And everyone that goes around comes around too You're a stranger I'm a girl I never stood a chance of knowing who you were From a distance it's all so clear May have spent some time with you But you were never here And though it must get lonely When you live without a friend Cause every single soul you leave You're gonna meet again chorus repeat
