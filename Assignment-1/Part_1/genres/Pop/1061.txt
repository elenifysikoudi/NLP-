Pushing through the topsoil I'm blinking in the light Shading my eyes from the morning sun I just wish that I could still see the world sometimes The way I saw the world when I was young Sleeping with a gun sleeping with a gun Sleeping with a gun under my pillow Sometimes it gets lonely being valiantly alone Sometimes I wish I was there with you I get sad just thinking of all the little things I never ever had the heart to do Sleeping with a gun sleeping with a gun Sleeping with a gun under my pillow
