"When you are eighteen You're a man who is ready Who is strong and who's steady You know what I mean When you are eighteen Then you should be respected And you don't need protected When you are eighteen When you are eighteen You are braver and bolder Than that crowd who are older You know who I mean 'Cos when you are eighteen With all those years to prepare you There's nothing can scare you When you are eighteen I'm ready to travel To follow my star To the places I've been dreaming of I'm ready for living I'm ready for life And I know that I'm ready for love But when you are eighteen They say ""Love's complicated And so over rated"" You know what I mean When you are eighteen They say ""Wait and don't worry"" And ""Hey What's your hurry 'Cos you're only eighteen"" I'm ready to travel To follow my star To the places I've been dreaming of I'm ready for living I'm ready for life And I know that I'm ready for love When you are eighteen With the world all around you It can sometimes astound you You know what I mean Just how little they know ha All those cowboys and chancers I've got more of the answers And I'm only eighteen "
