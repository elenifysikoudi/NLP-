I can't believe I'm going to die one day Cant believe we'll all be gone Cant believe that I won't be 25 for much longer now It's weird this room is going to disappear And that someone lived here before It's weird I live in four dimensions but there might be more but it's all but it's all beautiful beautiful beautiful there's nothing left to say you're beautiful you're beautiful there's nothing left to say may you live in interesting times may you live in interesting times I can't believe this all came from dust and all of some people I love can't believe that I might just be projecting a dream and I hope this finds you when things are good and I hope that you're not facing loss and I hope yea I hope you find someone out there who loves you a lot but it's all but it's all beautiful beautiful beautiful there's nothing else to say you're beautiful you're beautiful there's nothing else to say may you live in interesting times may you live in interesting times
