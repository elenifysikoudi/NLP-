I want you Oh baby don't you love me Don't break my heart I want you Cause everytime you leave me I need your arms around me I need your arms around me I need your arms around me I need your love tonight Another lonely night Another day goes by without you You're always on my mind And everytime I dream about you This love will last forever Tell me that you're mine that you're mine We need to stay together Always side by side I want you Oh baby don't you love me Don't break my heart I want you `Cause everytime you leave me I need your arms around me Your love is like a fire love is like a fire My only sweet desire I need your love tonight Don't wanna make you cry And never say goodbye oh baby My love is all around I'll never let you down believe me This love will last forever Tell me that you're mine that you're mine We need to stay together Always side by side I want you Oh baby don't you love me Don't break my heart I want you Cause everytime you leave me I need your arms around me Your love is like a fire love is like a fire My only sweet desire I need your love tonight Oh baby Don't you love me Don't break my heart I want you Cause everytime you leave me I need your love I want you Oh baby don't you leave me Oh baby don't you leave me Oh baby don't you leave me Don't break my heart I want you
