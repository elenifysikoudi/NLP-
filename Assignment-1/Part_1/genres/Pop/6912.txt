"Whoa oh oh Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Whoa oh oh Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa In the lonely night I wake up to find Someone else's boy Always on my mind But he doesn't know How much I really love him so Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Though it isn't right When I dream like this I long to hold him tight And to taste his kiss And then I wake to find He's someone else's boy Not mi i i i ine Whenever I see them together It breaks my poor heart in two I know that I should forget him ""Cause he's her guy But what can I do Whoa whoa whoa whoa How I hope and pray To the Lord above To send me down a boy One that I can love Who'll be mine alone And not someone else's boy "
