Ba da da da Ba da da da Ba da da da Ba da da da Ba da da da Ba da da da Ba da da da > Looking from a window above It's like a story of love Can you hear me Came back only yesterday Moving further away Won't you hear me All I needed was the love you gave All I needed for another day All I ever knew Only you Sometimes when I think of your name And it's only a game And I need you Listening to the words that you say Getting harder to stay When I see you All I needed was the love you gave All I needed for another day All I ever knew Only you Ba da Ba da da da Ba da da da Ba da da da Ba da da da> Ba da Ba da All I needed was the love you gave All I needed for another day All I ever knew Only you This is gonna take a long time And I wonder what's mine Can't take no more Wonder if you'll understand It's just the touch of your hand Behind a closed door All I needed was the love you gave All I needed for another day All I ever knew Only you Ba da da da Ba da da da Ba da da da Ba da da da Ba da da da Ba da da da Ba da da da
