This is the sound of our days Burning the light of our nights This is the sign of our times From my mouth into your eyes This is the beat of our praise Setting the pace of our stride This is the line that we cross With my torch I light your way When the time is right We raise our heads and look When the bridges burn We leave our homes in flames This is the noise of our blood Telling the age of our nerves This is the price of our lies From my lips into your breath This is the voice of our past Turning the tide of our lives These are the tears that we cry With my tongue I touch your mind When the time is right We raise our heads and look When the bridges burn We leave our homes in flames When the time is right We raise our heads and look When the bridges burn We leave our homes in flames
