Just you and me lost inside of love Feeling ecstasy and we cannot get enough You move in closer now and it's driving me crazy Try to hide it somehow but I lose my self control Should I just let it go Should I get tight with you Give to me give to me talk to me talk to me Baby you can show me what this love is all about Give to me give to me talk to me talk to me Maybe you can show me what this love is all about So here we are pure in the moment This is our time don't let it get away I look into your eyes tell me what I want to know Now won't you look into mine and you'll see the love it shows Should I just let it go Should I get tight with you Give to me give to me talk to me talk to me Baby you can show me what this love is all about Give to me give to me talk to me talk to me Maybe you can show me what this love is all about Should I just let it go Should I cause I really don't know Let me give you everything I want to give you Let me take you to the place I want to take you to Let me show you all the things I want to show you Give to me give to me talk to me talk to me Baby you can show me what this love is all about Give to me give to me talk to me talk to me Maybe you can show me what this love is all about
