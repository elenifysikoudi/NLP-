A thousand times I've failed Still your mercy remains Should I stumble again Still I'm caught in your grace Everlasting your light will shine when all else fades Never ending your glory goes beyond all fame Your will above all else My purpose remains The art of losing myself in bringing you praise Everlasting your light will shine when all else fades Never ending your glory goes beyond all fame In my heart in my soul I give you control Consume me from the inside out Let justice and praise Become my embrace To love you from the inside out Your will above all else My purpose remains The art of losing myself in bringing you praise Everlasting your light will shine when all else fades Never ending your glory goes beyond all fame In my heart in my soul I give you control Consume me from the inside out Let justice and praise Become my embrace To love you from the inside out x 2 Everlasting your light will shine when all else fades Never ending your glory goes beyond all fame And the cry of my heart is to bring you praise From the inside out Lord my soul cries out cries out from the inside of my soul cries out
