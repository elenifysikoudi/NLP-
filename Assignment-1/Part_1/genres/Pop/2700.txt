I feel too many affectious obstacles water must be allowed to seek it's own level I don't seek to strive on others expense and the expense is mine as they judge my ways I'm waiting for the rain to fall for days I'm longing for the flood to sweep this all away to grind the mountains to the level of the valleys to cut the trees to the level of the grass to asphalt the land in the name of equality let us grow in mutual respect and care I will transgress the laws and change the orders to live within an environment of my choice so don't force your will or taste to rule over mine don't stand in the shadow of my hammer
