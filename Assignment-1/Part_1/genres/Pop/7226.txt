Life is easy where youre coming from You take what pleases and you turn it on Born from a wayward style thats running wild Youre the stranger that was ever known You know I was living on doubts You know I was living on odds Youre my favorite You started a fire In the heart of a wasted life Ive got something to burn Anytime anyway you like Take me closer than I've ever been Paint a canvas like I've never seen Red for the blood that drives you ever round Youre the danger I've been waiting on You know I was living on doubts You know I was living on odds Youre my favorite You started a fire In the heart of a wasted life Ive got something to burn Anytime anyway you like You started a fire In the heart of a wasted life Ive got something to burn Anytime anyway you like Its just the way that you are Its just the way that you are Its just the way that you are Its just the way that you are We like the way that you are We like the way that you are Its just the way that you are We like the way that you are We like the way that you are We like the way that you are We like the way that you are
