Sitting in the silence kissing under the stars There's no better place tonight I'd rather be baby I don't wanna see this passion falling apart Nothing really matters if you wanna leave darling Without your love I'll never be the same no beat in my heart Without your smile I'll never feel that way no beat in my soul Without your soul I'll never see the light But this time I know can't you see Summerlovers are always just like this Boys and girls who fall in love on the beach They can be together but love won't last forever Summerlovers will always be just Like you and me Sitting in the silence watching summer go by There's no need to say this love is driving me crazy Babe I can't believe it but we just say goodbye Suddenly I feel I'm gonna miss you my darling Without your love I'll never be the same Without your smile I'll never feel that way Without your soul I'll never see the light But this time I know can't you see Summerlovers are always just like this
