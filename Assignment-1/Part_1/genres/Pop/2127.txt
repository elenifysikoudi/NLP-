"Run for words I nearly catch fire radiate slumber in this quest I'm your wire Running for ways I mouth that I'm scared radiate wonder this flesh just your fringe Fear these chains are all I have tonight so I simply forgive Rings have made you sigh in the work of my Waiting for word I nearly catch fire never quite noticed you quench and I'm you lighter Fear these chains are all I have tonight some forgive and some forget rings of pages sigh In the work of my own life that I Enter this this halo Do you deny this kind of love If you were once Cain or Abel Then you recite this bolder life Through this wide open heart Do you believe this ""dying we part"" Do you believe this Fear these chains are all I wear tonight some forgive some forget rings of pages signs in the work of my own life was my gift to you Fear these chains are all I have tonight so I simply forgive In the work of my own life I give to you"
