"I was such a fool to fall in love with you I was such a fool to think you loved me too ""Cause suddenly something happened Your love flickered and died But mine mine kept right on burning Then burst into a tide Impossible to hide Oh I was such a fool to think that you were mine Here's to your new love Let's drink a toast of sparkling wine Oh you taught me a lesson it's true But wait til it happens to you Oh I was such a fool to fall in love with you Oh ho you know You taught me a lesson it's true But wait til it happens to you I was such a fool to fall in love with you "
