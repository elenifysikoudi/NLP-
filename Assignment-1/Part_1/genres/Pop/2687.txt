I consume the wind that makes you cold and drink the blood of the bleeding souls to check your fear and hide the noise of the howling wolves that steals your voice I confuse your mind and feed your dreams to read your thoughts and keep them safe from harmful truth and the hopeful lies of the tempting demon that hurts your eyes I will protect you from your visions to safe you from illusions I will protect you from ideals to safe you from defeats I consume the wind that makes you bold and suck the blood of the living souls to make you numb and hide the noise of the howling wolves that is your voice I seduce your mind to fear your dreams and read your thoughts to keep you blind from harmful truth and the open skies of the outside world before your eyes
