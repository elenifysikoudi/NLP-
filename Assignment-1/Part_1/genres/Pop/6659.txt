Love is blind some may say But I saw clearly on that day A perfect picture a perfect view A perfect person a perfect you And yesterday becomes today And tomorrow becomes forever The beauty of you remains engraved In my heart and mind forever The Perfect Love Yesterday I had the sweetest dream I dreamt an angel came to visit me She taught me how to live and how to trust Showed me the meaning of being in love She placed he footprints across the sky This angel took my breath away Like a kid on Christmas day To my surprise my angel is you II can't believe this dream came true I found a perfect love I've searched so far and wide for you An angel from above I can't believe this dream came true Her voice is like a song in my heart I play it every time that we're apart She soothes my body with just one touch I know that's why I really love her so much She stole my heart with just one kiss And made me fall so deep in love Just can't seem to get enough To my surprise the angel is you I can't believe this dream came true Chorus The more I see you the more I love you The more I think of you the more I want to be with you Quero che me ams con todo su kurason I want you to give your heart to me Tidaro quell che vuoi I shall give you what you want Quero che siempre eres nio I want you to spend eternity with me Thelo na sagapo ya pand I want to love you forever I can't stop saying that I love you Je t'aime ouci mon cher I love you also my darling Chorus out
