However long I'm under makes no difference However long I'm down there'll be air for me And ll I've had that's lost that's gone it falls away And I'll come up in my time there'll be no fear for me I walk down this easy path where shadows fall behind And rest beneath the trees and wait for me Lost where I belong lost where I've gone And lost is my new home lost where I belong Usually darkness gets to me this place is mine No idea what led me to more peace than home Dressed in blue she takes me through no doubt for me To follow right behind the sun is blind and I can't see Lost where I belong lost where I've gone And lost is my new home lost where I belong 'Cause lost where I belong lost where I've gone And lost is my new home lost where I belong I can walk With no end Nothing hurts Nothing's pain Nothing's missed No one's gone Moved away And nothing's wrong Lost where I belong lost where I've gone Lost is where I belong
