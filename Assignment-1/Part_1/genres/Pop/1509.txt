Ain't no sunshine When he's gone It's not warm when he's away Ain't no sunshine When he's gone And he's always gone too long Any time he goes away Wonder this time Where he's gone Wonder if he's gonna stay Ain't no sunshine When he's gone This house Just ain't no home Any time he goes away And I know I know I know I know You know the reason Why he packed up Like he didn't hear you When you said He ought to back up It's alright he enticed you With that pillow talk Not you this time it's him Who's going to take a walk Right down memory lane Your name is not lois And he ain't Forrest Gump So bump he pumped Cause he ain't real Just kick it Like brandy on the move Hey I'm gonna Leave young thing alone But ain't no sunshine When he's gone
